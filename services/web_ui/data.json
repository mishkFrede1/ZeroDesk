It also prevents Trump from enforcing his tariffs placed earlier this year against China, Mexico and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States.\r\n\r\nThe court ruled in favor of a permanent injunction, potentially grinding Trump’s global tariffs to a halt before “deals” with most other trading partners have even been reached. The court ordered a window of 10 calendar days for administrative orders “to effectuate the permanent injunction.” That means the bulk – but not all – of Trump’s tariffs would be put in a standstill if the ruling holds up in appeal and, potentially, with the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe order halts Trump’s 30% tariffs on China, his 25% tariffs on some goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and the 10% universal tariffs on most goods coming into the United States. It does not, however, affect the 25% tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel or aluminum, which were subject to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act – a different law than the one Trump cited for his broader trade actions.", "category": 2, "likes_count": 29, "dislikes_count": 11, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-05-29T08:51:29.803Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-31T09:21:06.951Z", "tags": [7, 13, 14]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 14, "fields": {"title": "Ukraine scrambles to set up ‘drone wall’ as it braces for Russian summer offensive", "slug": "article-2", "summary": "Russia dramatically intensified missile and drone attacks across Ukraine this month in an effort to sap Ukrainians’ morale – but it is also stepping up ground attacks in many areas along the long frontline, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts.", "image": "article_images/2025/05/29/2025-05-25t054123z-2135375881-rc2toea8x3p6-rtrmadp-3-ukraine-_mT8k72I.webp", "content": "Some of those attacks have succeeded, with Ukrainian units in Donetsk and the north falling back from some positions, while some rural areas in the south have also been lost.\r\n\r\nBut Ukraine’s own enhanced use of drones, deployed in several layers on the battlefield, has helped Kyiv inflict heavy losses on the opposing forces with minimal casualties among its own troops.

Those teams never won, but coming close became good enough for their older counterparts who clung to the memories of “almost” winning and tightened their grip on nostalgia as the hopelessness increased.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a long drought. It’s been a heartbreaking drought because it’s not like we haven’t been close,” Velázquez said. “Last year, it was finally good to hear that song ‘Go NY Go’ because before it was not something you wanted to blast on your radio.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first time in 25 years that the Knicks have gone this far in the playoffs, but the gut punches the team and their fans have taken dates back further. From Michael Jordan’s three-peats to Reggie Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds, followed by Patrick Ewing’s missed layup in 1995 and the injury-riddled squad willing itself to the Finals in 1999, only to get crushed by the San Antonio Spurs, fans have had hope and then watched it get swatted away.\r\n\r\nThose heartbreaking moments led to the slow and steady decline that started in the 2000s. Each move the Knicks made – whether it was bringing in Isiah Thomas as president of basketball operations in late 2003, trading for Brooklyn’s own Stephon Marbury, or then Knicks president Phil Jackson drafting Kristaps Porziņģis – the fleeting hope always gave way to despair.\r\n\r\nThe consecutive sellout streak of Madison Square Garden was gone and so were the A-list stars.\r\n\r\nThe Carmelo Anthony-led Knicks had a brief resurgence, even making the second round of the playoffs before they lost in six games to the Indiana Pacers in 2013. Jeremy Lin in 2012 caught fire and famously scored 38 points to beat the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers as one of the highlights of the short-lived “Linsanity” era.\r\n\r\nBut from that point, it was quiet at Madison Square Garden – until now. Despite being down 3-1 in the series, the Knicks are playing in the Eastern Conference Finals, something they haven’t done in 25 years.\r\n\r\n“It’s decades of disappointment coming out. That’s what I hear,” author Paul Knepper told CNN of the cheers coming from Knicks fans.\r\n\r\nKnepper is a longtime Knicks supporter, took his fandom several steps further and wrote “The Knicks of the Nineties.” The book chronicles the rise and fall of what could be considered the golden era of Knicks basketball for those who weren’t old enough to see Willis Reed hobble onto the Madison Square Garden hardwood for the championship clinching game against the Lakers in 1970 or the subsequent title in 1973.\r\n\r\nKnepper, who grew up on Long Island, was watching Game 1 against the Pacers with his wife in Austin, Texas, where they live. Knepper said she’s not a Knicks fan but roots for them, even though the anxiety and pressure of seeing the historic collapse was almost too painful to watch.\r\n\r\n“She’s like, ‘I don’t know how you do this. This is terrible. How do you watch games like this?’ And I said, ‘I’ve felt this pain before,’” Knepper said. “I felt this pain with Reggie Miller. I felt this pain when Charles Smith couldn’t make a layup in 1993 against the Bulls. I’m familiar with this pain.”\r\n\r\nKnepper says he hears both joy and relief in the screams and cheers from fans.\r\n\r\n“I don’t hear the Carmelo Anthony or the Jeremy Lin era. I hear Phil Jackson and trading Porziņģis and Charles Oakley getting kicked out of the Garden, which, for me, I think, personally, was probably the lowest point in this whole terrible, extended era,” Knepper told CNN Sports. “That’s the kind of stuff that I hear.

But this rural scene featuring a hay wagon fording a Suffolk millpond is, she says, \"an idealised image\". In fact, the more we learn about The Hay Wain, the less we can trust its depiction of England.\r\n\r\nExploring the diverse meanings that artists past and present attach to the landscapes they depict was the subject of an exhibition at Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, National Treasures: Constable in Bristol − \"Truth to Nature\", starring The Hay Wain. The iconic 6ft-wide oil painting, frequently voted one of Britain's favourite artworks, was on loan from London's National Gallery as part of the museum's bicentenary celebrations in 2024. Now it has returned to the National Gallery, it is the focal point of Discover Constable & The Hay Wain, an exploration of the painting's creation and different reactions to it, which opened in October.\r\n\r\nThere's no doubt that Constable (1776-1837), who leaned more towards Romanticism than Realism, imbued his landscape with the sentimental attachment he had to it. He grew up just a mile from the whitewashed cottage to the left of the canvas, owned by tenant farmer Willy Lott, with its charming view over millpond and cornfields, and he rhapsodised about \"the beauty of the surrounding scenery, its gentle declivities, its luxuriant meadow flats…\", writing: \"I associate 'my careless boyhood' with all that lies on the banks of the Stour\".\r\n\r\nYet the rural way of life he depicted did not reflect the industrialisation that was rapidly altering the landscape at the time of painting. While his contemporary JMW Turner was painting a steam train slicing through the canvas, Constable was looking back rather than forward. In many ways, The Hay Wain is a scene that's too good to be true, an anachronism that speaks more to his nostalgia than offering a faithful portrait of rural Suffolk.\r\n\r\nFar from being an objective record of the countryside, the scene inevitably reflects Constable's own standing in society as the son of a landowner, Christine Riding, Director of Collections and Research at the National Gallery, tells the BBC. Just off-canvas is Flatford Mill, owned by the Constable family since 1742. \"He knows that landscape very well, but he knows it from a position of privilege,\" she says. \"It all looks very natural and contented. People know their place in society and are just getting on with it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the scene is less happy when you consider the social context. The agricultural workers pictured in the background often laboured under poor conditions in a precarious and bloated employment market, could not afford to eat the bread that they helped produce, and were about to face even greater hardship when replaced by machines.\r\n\r\nThe picture also ignores the Enclosure Acts (between 1604 and 1914) that placed rural spaces in the hands of the few. \"By the time you get to The Hay Wain, there is very little common land,\" explains Riding. \"He's painting places that his father and his brother have ownership over… but you don't see owners, only labourers.\"", "category": 8, "likes_count": 28, "dislikes_count": 6, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-05-31T17:09:52.879Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T12:26:02.408Z", "tags": [17]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 24, "fields": {"title": "Inside the fascinating world of India's blind cave-dwelling fish", "slug": "article-12", "summary": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.", "image": "article_images/2025/05/31/7cd78d30-3c65-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp", "content": "It was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels -

the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\r\n\r\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\r\n\r\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\r\n\r\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\r\n\r\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\r\n\r\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\r\n\r\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\r\n\r\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators.\r\n\r\nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\r\n\r\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\r\n\r\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\r\n\r\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\r\n\r\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\r\n\r\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\r\n\r\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\r\n\r\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\r\n\r\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"", "category": 9, "likes_count": 24, "dislikes_count": 8, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-05-31T17:13:59.997Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T09:25:15.135Z", "tags": [7, 18]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "How protests over designer handbags threw Mongolia into political crisis", "slug": "article-13", "summary": "Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with protesters calling for the resignation of the country’s prime minister over his family’s lavish displays of wealth.", "image": "article_images/2025/06/02/gettyimages-2215724127.webp", "content": "For two weeks, young Mongolians have taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai who will face a vote of confidence in his government on Monday.\r\n\r\nDemocratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country’s democracy.\r\n\r\nHere’s what to know:\r\nThe protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister’s 23-year-old son’s lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car.\r\n\r\nSuspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family.\r\n\r\n“With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy).\r\n\r\nAmina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people.", "category": 4, "likes_count": 11, "dislikes_count": 7, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-06-02T09:26:05.057Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T09:26:05.057Z", "tags": [7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 26, "fields": {"title": "How San Francisco’s Castro district became the capital of LGBT America", "slug": "article-14", "summary": "In 1965, Life magazine declared San Francisco the capital of gay America.

This phenomenon isn't just about comfort; it's a psychological transformation where we shed our everyday identities through clothing. Unlike the utilitarian outfits designed for pilgrimages or trade expeditions of the past, contemporary holiday attire represents what Marta Franceschini of the European Fashion Heritage Association calls \"a certain relaxation of social dress codes.\" The trend began in the mid-1800s when railways made seaside resorts accessible, prompting new fashion hybrids of elegance and practicality using breathable fabrics like linen. As Franceschini explains: \"The post-World War Two economic boom, coupled with the advent of commercial aviation, democratised travel further. From the 1950s to the '70s, leisurewear evolved into a distinct genre: Capri pants, resort prints, kaftans and cruise collections became staples.\" By the interwar period, designers like Coco Chanel championed relaxed styles that freed travelers from traditional constraints.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0chx.jpg.webp' alt='Getty Images The rise of leisure travel in the mid-1800s brought warm weather destinations into vogue and necessitated lighter fabrics (Credit: Getty Images)'><p>Despite these sartorial freedoms, there's widespread aversion to appearing like a stereotypical tourist, driven by what Dr. Charlotte Russell of The Travel Psychologist identifies as negative connotations of seeming \"naïve\" or \"clumsy with cultural differences.\" Publications overflow with advice on avoiding the reviled tourist uniform - T-shirt, backpack, and hat - while Vanessa Friedman, New York Times fashion critic, taps locals for discreet style guidance because \"people dress to belong... when you're travelling, you don't want to stand out.\" Franceschini traces this anxiety to the late 20th century when globalization widened the \"increasingly codified\" gap between short-term tourists and long-term travelers. Dr. Andrew Stevenson, author of The Psychology of Travel, reframes the dilemma: \"Do you want to present yourself as somebody who's trying to blend in, like an anthropologist? Or erect a barrier because you've got safety concerns? Clothes symbolize how much belongingness we want.\" This psychological tension manifests whether we're signaling professional identity or cultural curiosity through rugged footwear or flowy ensembles.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0cpl.jpg.webp' alt='Alamy What&apos;s so terrible about looking like a tourist, anyway? (Credit: Alamy)'><p>The White Lotus exemplified this identity-performance gap when Jennifer Coolidge's character interpreted Italian style through cinematic clichés, earning Peppa Pig comparisons instead of Monica Vitti glamour. Franceschini calls this \"sartorial mimicry,\" where garments express \"an imagined desire to assimilate with local culture,\" though she cautions it risks cultural appropriation when lacking contextual understanding. The Instagram era amplifies these performances, with Russell noting travelers increasingly replicate dressed-up influencers at landmarks that 15 years ago saw functional attire. Franceschini describes how outfits become \"integral to performative self-branding\" with sponsored wardrobes and coordinated palettes, while Stevenson observes: \"Now people take photographs of themselves, and the places... are in the background.\" Betty White's quip resonates: \"Facebook just sounds like a drag; in my day, seeing pictures of people's vacations was considered punishment.\" Ultimately, Franceschini frames holiday dressing as \"a sartorial manifestation of freedom,\" with Russell affirming vacations let us explore \"a more carefree, joyful\" self through clothing choices that defy routine judgments.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0dh3.jpg.webp' alt='Getty Images Going someplace new can be a cause for celebration, so it can be fun to dress for the occasion (Credit: Getty Images)'>", "category": 9, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-06-15T13:20:45.640Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-15T13:20:45.640Z", "tags": [7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 56, "fields": {"title": "Equine Therapy Helps Incarcerated Veterans Heal Trauma", "slug": "horse-therapy-veterans", "summary": "A groundbreaking Texas program uses horse-assisted therapy to help incarcerated US veterans address trauma, as nearly one-third of war veterans face arrest or imprisonment - double the civilian rate.", "image": "article_images/2025/06/17/title_image_KraA3b1.webp", "content": "<p><strong>Trigger warning</strong> This article contains graphic descriptions of violence that some readers may find upsetting.</p><h2>A Novel Approach to Veteran Rehabilitation</h2><p>Nearly one-third of the US's war veterans have been arrested or jailed at some point in their lives.

Unlike remote wildlife areas, this refuge sits just 90 minutes from the bustling theme parks of Orlando, blending protected dunes with developed beachfront properties. Sea Turtle Conservancy director David Godfrey explains that thousands of loggerhead and green turtles, along with dozens of leatherbacks, rely on this zone annually for mating and nesting, making it a global biodiversity hotspot where humans and nature must harmoniously coexist for conservation to succeed.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljnc9n.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Alamy The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge is just 90 minutes away from heavily-touristed Orlando (Credit: Alamy)\"/><h2>Threats to Ancient Nesting Rituals</h2><p>Female sea turtles instinctively return to their birth beaches every few years to nest, but this age-old cycle faces modern challenges like light pollution and human structures. Nichole Perna, a land management specialist at the refuge, notes that bright lights can scare turtles away, preventing nesting entirely. Blair Witherington of Inwater Research Group adds that barriers such as breakwaters block access to sandy areas, potentially forcing turtles to abort nests in water where eggs won't survive. The stakes are alarmingly high: only one in 1,000 hatchlings reaches adulthood due to these threats, contributing to why six out of seven sea turtle species are endangered.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljncb1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mariana Zapata It's crucial to avoid disturbing sea turtle nests on Florida's beaches (Credit: Mariana Zapata)\"/><h2>Community-Driven Conservation Success</h2><p>To protect nesting turtles during the season from March to October, the refuge enforces strict rules, including bans on nighttime beach activities, noise, and handheld lights. Property owners must eliminate visible lighting or use low, shielded fixtures with long wavelengths to avoid disorienting turtles. Perna credits these regulations, education campaigns, and development controls for the refuge's dramatic recovery: nest numbers climbed from roughly 13,000 in 1983 to over 44,000 in 2023, establishing it as the world's largest loggerhead nesting ground. However, conflicts occasionally arise, such as when fishermen using lights disturbed a turtle during a guided tour, though Ranger Mairi Brooks noted most visitors cooperate willingly when informed, reinforcing the balance between human recreation and wildlife safety.</p><h2>Experiencing Nature's Wonders Firsthand</h2><p>Guided tours at the refuge offer rare opportunities to observe sea turtles in their natural habitat, like the loggerhead named Jolene monitored by visitors during the nesting season. Participants watch as turtles enter a trance-like state while laying eggs—a behavior unchanged for 100 million years, according to Godfrey. Tours, which run from June for nest watching and August for hatchling surveys, help build public support for conservation by fostering what Witherington calls 'an enthusiastic sea turtle constituency,' demonstrating that protection efforts yield both ecological and economic benefits. Beyond turtles, the refuge supports diverse wildlife such as bobcats, manatees, and mangroves, proving its role as a broader ecosystem sanctuary.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljncby.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brevard County EEL Program Only one in a thousand successfully laid sea turtle eggs will make it to adulthood (Credit: Brevard County EEL Program)\"/><p>For travelers, affordable stays at Floridana Beach Motel or Seashell Suites Resort provide access to local attractions including Juan Ponce de León Landing, Sebastian Inlet State Park, and the Barrier Island Center with interactive sea turtle exhibits.

Speaking at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, she argued the law too often \"protects those who break the rules\" and announced the government would clarify how human rights laws operate. While reaffirming UK commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), Mahmood insisted the 1950 treaty must evolve to address modern challenges.</p><h2>Article 8 Controversies</h2><p>The government plans new legislation targeting Article 8 of the ECHR, which guarantees the right to family life. Mahmood cited cases where foreign criminals invoked this article to avoid deportation, calling it \"out of step with common sense.\" She also noted dangerous prisoners using the same provision to challenge placement in separation centers. The minister expressed concern over perceptions that human rights have become \"a tool for criminals to avoid responsibility\" rather than protecting the vulnerable.</p><h2>Conservative Position</h2><p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has taken a harder stance, arguing the UK must prepare to leave the ECHR entirely to regain border control. She described the convention as a \"sword used to attack democratic decisions\" especially regarding deportations. A Conservative commission is examining potential withdrawal consequences, with findings due this autumn. The party proposes disapplying human rights law from immigration cases entirely to allow deportation of all foreign offenders.</p><h2>International Alignment</h2><p>Other nations have echoed calls for reform. Nine countries including Italy and Denmark recently complained the ECHR sometimes \"resulted in the protection of the wrong people,\" particularly regarding criminal deportations. Alain Berset, president of the Council of Europe, acknowledged the treaty needed to \"adapt\" to a changing world. This international push comes as the UK government explores reforming the ECHR's domestic implementation.</p><h2>Opposition Warnings</h2><p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey strongly opposes leaving the convention, warning it would put Britain \"right next to Vladimir Putin's Russia.\" While supporting discussions about updating certain provisions, he emphasized that most elements function \"extraordinary well\" for citizens' rights.

In just 10 hours of initial operation, it detected 2,104 new asteroids and seven near-Earth objects - a detection rate that far exceeds the typical annual discovery of 20,000 space rocks by all other telescopes combined.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a553/live/5cf2dc50-4dfd-11f0-86d5-3b52b53af158.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Virgo cluster image showing spiral galaxies, merging galaxies and distant galaxy groups captured by Vera Rubin\"/><p>Perched atop Cerro Pachón in the Chilean Andes, the observatory operates under stringent darkness conditions to capture faint astronomical light. Scientists have engineered specialized features including a unique three-mirror system with an 8.4-meter primary mirror that enables observation of extremely distant objects from the universe's early epochs.</p><p>The telescope's 3,200-megapixel camera, weighing 2,800kg, requires 400 ultra-HD screens to display a single full-resolution image. During its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time, it will capture panoramic shots every 40 seconds across 8-12 hour nights, repositioning rapidly to film cosmic changes.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3361/live/7e7fecf0-4df3-11f0-a466-d54f65b60deb.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Person in cleanroom suit standing beside the large cylindrical telescope with reflective lenses\"/><p>The comprehensive survey will map the Milky Way's boundaries up to 1.2 million light-years away - a sevenfold increase over current capabilities - while hunting for small satellite galaxies and solving mysteries like dark matter. The UK, as a key project partner, will process the flood of data at dedicated centers receiving up to 10 million nightly alerts about transient objects.</p><p>Scientists are optimistic the observatory could locate hypothesized Planet Nine at 700 times Earth's distance from the sun and track potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids.

All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200.\" After sending $800 in gift cards, the scammer requested additional payments for a \"broken-down truck\" supposedly delivering her prize.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/1200/675/1-elon-musk-impersonator-scams-victims-with-tesla-apple-gift-card-hoax.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"musk facebook scam 1\"/><h2>How the Scam Operates</h2><p>Scammers monitor public Facebook posts about Musk, Tesla, or cryptocurrency before sending friend requests using the billionaire's name and photos. These fake profiles appear credible with reposted news articles and AI-generated content. Once contact is made, fraudsters use flattery and false urgency to pressure victims. \"He kept telling me it was my lucky day,\" the Florida victim recounted, illustrating how scammers escalate demands after initial payments.</p><p>The fraudulent operation relies heavily on gift cards due to their anonymity and irreversibility. After obtaining card codes, scammers quickly resell them or make untraceable purchases. Apple Gift Cards are particularly favored, though Google Play, Amazon, Steam, and prepaid Visa cards are also used. Victims are pressured to buy the cards while staying on the phone and to immediately share the codes before second thoughts arise.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/1200/675/2-elon-musk-impersonator-scams-victims-with-tesla-apple-gift-card-hoax.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"Musk facebook scam 2\"/><h2>Red Flags and Protection</h2><p>These schemes exploit familiar figures like Musk alongside sophisticated tools such as deepfake videos and AI-generated voice recordings to create false trust. Scammers manufacture urgency by demanding quick action and secrecy. Experts emphasize that no legitimate organization or celebrity giveaway requires gift card payments for fees, prize releases, or identity verification.</p><p>Defensive measures include verifying identity through official channels, refusing any gift card payment requests from strangers, and reporting suspicious accounts to Facebook. Authentic public figures won't message about unexpected prizes, and unsolicited offers of free money or exclusive opportunities should be treated with extreme skepticism. Users encountering such scams should immediately block the accounts and notify the social media platform.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/1200/675/3-elon-musk-impersonator-scams-victims-with-tesla-apple-gift-card-hoax.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"musk facebook scam 3\"/>", "category": 5, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-06-27T12:23:17.207Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-27T12:23:17.207Z", "tags": [160, 253, 346, 347, 348, 349]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 228, "fields": {"title": "Iran Downplays Nuclear Site Damage Following US Strike, Expert Claims", "slug": "iran-downplays-nuclear-damage-after-us-strike", "summary": "Analysts suggest Iran is attempting to minimize perception of damage sustained during recent U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities, while Israel claims the operation significantly set back Tehran's uranium enrichment capabilities, as conflicting assessments emerge about the operation's effectiveness.", "image": "article_images/2025/06/27/title_image_JP6nmLs.webp", "content": "<p>Early damage assessments of Iranian nuclear facilities hit by U.S. military strikes may be premature and potentially inaccurate according to political analysts.

About 7% of UK pupils attend 2,500 private schools. Exceptions to the VAT charge apply for students with special education plans arranged by local authorities and military families receiving boarding grants.</p><h2>Fee Increases and Enrollment Concerns</h2><p>Fees surged 22.6% between January 2024 and 2025 according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which cited VAT implementation, national insurance hikes, and business rate changes. While fee growth historically hasn't reduced enrollment, ISC reports a 4.6% decline in Year 7 starters for 2024. Projections suggest between 35,000-54,000 pupils may shift to state schools.</p><h2>Legal Challenges</h2><p>The ISC, faith schools, and parent groups sued the government, arguing the policy violates human rights and discriminates against lower-income religious schools and special needs students. Government lawyers maintained families opt out of state education voluntarily. Officials rejected delaying implementation despite considering a September 2025 start, prioritizing revenue generation for the 94% in state education.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c033dp0z1edo#1\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 4, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-06-27T15:27:42.067Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-27T15:27:42.067Z", "tags": [93, 95, 112, 176, 248]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 257, "fields": {"title": "Orca Innovations: Killer Whales Craft Kelp Tools for Social Massages", "slug": "orca-kelp-tools-social-massages", "summary": "Researchers discovered killer whales in the North Pacific using kelp as tools to massage each other.

Wales ranks as Britain's most expensive region for under-twos at £15,038 per year. Costs for three and four-year-olds rose across England, Scotland, and Wales despite expanded government support.</p><h2>How does free childcare in England work?</h2><p>All three and four-year-olds in England receive 15 hours of government-funded childcare weekly regardless of parental employment status. Working parents become eligible for 30 weekly hours beginning September. Eligibility requires annual earnings between £9,518 and £100,000 for most applicants. Parents receiving certain benefits or partners on parental leave may also qualify for 30 hours.</p><h2>How do you apply for free childcare hours?</h2><p>Applications must be submitted before the start of the school term following the child reaching qualifying age. Government websites provide specific deadlines for each age group. The free hours are designed for 38 weeks annually during term time, though providers may stretch them over 52 weeks with reduced weekly usage.</p><h2>What is not covered by the free childcare funding?</h2><p>Despite government rate increases, many providers charge extra for meals, nappies, sunscreen, and activities, as funding doesn't cover full costs. A Pregnant Then Screwed study shows 23% of surveyed parents couldn't afford to use free hours due to these top-up fees. The Department for Education now mandates that parents can opt out of extras to prevent exclusion, leading more than 5,000 nurseries to request delayed implementation.</p><h2>Are there enough childcare places?</h2><p>The government estimates needing 35,000 additional staff and 70,000 new places by September 2025 to meet expanded demand. While childcare spots increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, distribution remains uneven nationally according to Ofsted. Childminder numbers declined after recruitment incentives ended, worsening shortages in low-income \"childcare desert\" areas.

I had one job: to win.\"</p><h2>Breaking away from Corbynism</h2><p>Having risen through Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Starmer initially offered \"Corbynism without Corbyn\" after winning Labour's leadership in 2020. He soon broke dramatically with his predecessor, centering the campaign not on sweeping pledges but on reassurance—vowing no increases to income tax, national insurance or VAT.

Starmer's prosecutorial background proved useful; within weeks, 200 rioters averaged two-year sentences.

Sullivan commended his handling of Donald Trump, calling their meeting the best he'd \"seen from a leader in early weeks\" after Starmer tactfully deployed a Royal invitation.

Pitt and co-star Damson Idris personally drove Formula 1 cars during filming, accumulating over 6,000 miles behind the wheel. Real-life F1 champion Lewis Hamilton consulted extensively to ensure technical accuracy, but current Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto offer definitive verdicts on the film's realism.</p><p>Gasly and Colapinto attended a special screening ahead of the movie's premiere during the Canadian Grand Prix weekend. They evaluated the depiction of driver experiences, team dynamics, race physics, and regulations.</p><h2>What F1: The Movie Gets Right</h2><p>Gasly highlighted the film's accurate portrayal of team responsibilities and pressure: \"The stakes of carrying the responsibility of a thousand people working in a team is very well showed. It's a sport where you put it all out there, but you're not always rewarded.\"</p><p>Colapinto emphasized how the film conveys the visceral experience missing from broadcasts: \"You can't feel the adrenaline, sound, or vibrations when watching on TV.

While dramatically effective, this storyline element violates official racing protocols.</p><h2>Race Order</h2><p>The film's montage placing the Belgian Grand Prix directly after Mexico's race drew criticism. Actual F1 scheduling clusters races regionally to minimize travel, with European races like Belgium occurring mid-season rather than after transatlantic events near the championship's conclusion.</p><h2>Intense Crash</h2><p>Gasly called the film's major crash sequence unrealistic: \"Hopefully we'll never see that happening on track.\" Though acknowledging it created tension, he noted real crashes rarely reach such extremes. Colapinto plainly stated: \"It's quite unrealistic.\" Director Kosinski acknowledged inspiration from the 1966 film 'Grand Prix,' and safety measures like the Halo device—implemented after Jules Bianchi's fatal 2014 crash—now prevent such dramatic incidents.</p><h2>Collateral Damage</h2><p>Gasly challenged Sonny's strategy of intentionally creating track debris: \"I really doubt the FIA will let that happen.\" Real drivers face severe penalties for deliberate actions, such as Max Verstappen recently earning penalty points for colliding with George Russell. In reality, Sonny's tactics would likely result in race bans or license suspensions rather than heroic outcomes.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65254856/f1-movie-fact-check-drivers-alpine-pierre-gasly-franco-colapinto/\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 11, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-01T12:09:33.997Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T12:09:33.997Z", "tags": [365, 475, 476, 477, 478]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 351, "fields": {"title": "Over 130 Charities Demand Closure of US-Israeli Gaza Aid Group", "slug": "charities-demand-closure-gaza-aid-group", "summary": "More than 130 humanitarian organizations including Oxfam, Save the Children, and Amnesty International have jointly called for the immediate shutdown of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, citing over 500 Palestinian deaths and nearly 4,000 injuries at militarized aid distribution sites.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/01/title_image_Za3p4D3.webp", "content": "<p>Humanitarian organizations worldwide are demanding the closure of the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), established with Israeli and US backing.

Starting Sunday, supermarkets and manufacturers will partner with officials to combat obesity through initiatives like prioritizing healthy product promotions, modifying loyalty program rewards, or redesigning store layouts. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the strategy \"radically different\" from previous approaches, shifting from enforcement to collaboration. Retailers will voluntarily report healthy food sales metrics, with targets negotiated between industry and government.</p><h2>Political Debate Over Personal Choice</h2><p>Opposition figures immediately criticized the plans as governmental overreach. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Helen Whately denounced the \"nanny state\" mandate, stating: \"Telling people what to buy is not up to government. I believe in personal responsibility.\" She contrasted the focus on supermarket layouts with broader NHS challenges. Streeting countered that reducing average daily calorie intake by just 50 would lift around 300,000 UK children and two million adults from obesity, emphasizing population-wide benefits beyond individual choices.</p><h2>Health Crisis and Cost Barriers</h2><p>Data reveals obesity's growing burden: over one-third of children become overweight by middle school in deprived areas, costing the NHS £11 billion annually. A Food Foundation study highlights financial obstacles—1,000 calories of fruits and vegetables cost £8.80 versus £4.30 for processed alternatives like ready meals and processed meats. Streeting noted that a 216-calorie daily reduction—equivalent to a bottle of soda—could halve obesity rates nationwide.</p><h2>Industry Response and Skepticism</h2><p>British Retail Consortium's Andrew Opie welcomed the plan but stressed inclusivity: \"Engaging all food businesses makes a difference. We consume 25% of calories outside home environments.\" Katharine Jenner of the Obesity Health Alliance praised its systemic focus on food accessibility rather than individual blame.

The wake-up call came when he saw death firsthand: \"When you see death happen in front of your face, it changes everything.\" After his father's passing during incarceration, Fausto focused on education, earning his high school diploma then becoming the facility's first associate degree graduate through Riverside City College.</p><p>Mentor Carlos Cervantes observed Fausto's transformation: \"He had the drive. The mindset.\" When offered placement in California's inmate firefighter program, Fausto accepted despite uncertainty - seeing an opportunity to earn time credits toward early release from his seven-year sentence. This 108-year-old program employs approximately 1,800 low-security inmates across 35 camps during fire season.</p><h2>Baptism by fire</h2><p>At Pine Grove Conservation Camp in Sierra Nevada foothills, Fausto endured rigorous training - hiking in ill-fitting size 13 boots that bloodied his feet. \"I don't want to quit,\" he insisted through the pain. His persistence paid off when he joined fire crews battling blazes across California. The work proved brutal: 24-hour shifts sleeping on charred ground, drinking a quart of water hourly to avoid dehydration, and facing temperatures exceeding 100°F during record-breaking heat waves.</p><p>Fausto learned to identify heat types - radiant, convection, and conduction - as flames sometimes lashed his cheeks. His crew created vital firebreaks by hand, clearing 300 feet of brush per hour without machinery. When the historic Palisades and Eaton fires erupted near his hometown in January 2025, Fausto's crew deployed immediately. \"We're leaving!\" they shouted, embarking on the seven-hour journey to Altadena where over 1,000 incarcerated firefighters joined the battle.</p><h2>Flames of transformation</h2><p>During rest periods at the Rose Bowl base camp, Fausto received life-changing news from mentor Michael Griggs. His re-entry plan had been approved - probation officials supported his college admission after reviewing his academic record. \"You're going to college,\" Griggs told the stunned firefighter, who still wore his CDC prisoner uniform. Cervantes watched in awe: \"A person getting ready to be released still on the front lines, risking his life.\"</p><p>Nine days into firefighting, a judge approved Fausto's immediate release. He arrived at Cal State San Bernardino carrying his possessions in a black plastic bag. Now majoring in biology, Fausto takes courses in human ecology, philosophy, and rock history while training for basketball tryouts. \"He's exactly where he needs to be,\" says Griggs. \"It represents what second chances look like.\"</p><p>Reflecting on his fire crewmate Gonzalo's definition of identity - \"I'm a man of business\" - Fausto embraces his own purpose: \"I'm here and I've got to do things right and make amends. Now I'm trying to be who I am.\" His journey from incarceration to education, marked by blistered feet amidst the flames, demonstrates that even in destruction, renewal can take root.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/health/a65065585/la-wildfires-incarcerated-firefighter-interview/\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 13, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-01T14:06:05.056Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T14:06:05.056Z", "tags": [7, 101, 112, 131]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 363, "fields": {"title": "M&S Eyes Full Online Recovery Within Four Weeks After Cyber Attack", "slug": "ms-online-recovery-four-weeks", "summary": "Marks & Spencer expects to fully restore online services including click-and-collect within four weeks as recovery progresses after an April cyber attack that halted half its digital operations.

The ripple effects extend to pharmaceutical innovation, as scientific uncertainty discourages investment in vaccine research.</p><h2>Rebuilding Trust Through Equity and Engagement</h2><p>Meaningful solutions require recognizing why distrust exists.

Mobile vaccination units to reach underserved areas<br>2. Collaboration with trusted community leaders<br>3.

Cause of the Fire</h2><p>The investigation found that moisture infiltration into a high-voltage transformer was the primary cause.

Moisture led to a short circuit, triggering sparks and a catastrophic failure that ignited the cooling oil inside.</p><h2>2.
