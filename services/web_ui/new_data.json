As bad as those times were, they don’t compare to watching his team so close to the NBA Finals - even if they did lose on Tuesday night and are now a heartbeat away from elimination.\r\n\r\n“I never once put my paper bag on, but it came close,” Velázquez, 56, a long-suffering New York fan from Queens, told CNN Sports.\r\n\r\nAs heartbreak and desperation faded to failure over an excruciating 25-year period, Knicks fans are now overwhelmed, knowing their team has a chance at winning a championship soon – even as they face a 3-1 series deficit to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\r\n\r\nThe return to sustained relevancy –- something that seemed next-to-impossible for over two decades –- is new for younger fans who never saw the beloved 1990’s teams. Those teams never won, but coming close became good enough for their older counterparts who clung to the memories of “almost” winning and tightened their grip on nostalgia as the hopelessness increased.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a long drought. It’s been a heartbreaking drought because it’s not like we haven’t been close,” Velázquez said. “Last year, it was finally good to hear that song ‘Go NY Go’ because before it was not something you wanted to blast on your radio.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first time in 25 years that the Knicks have gone this far in the playoffs, but the gut punches the team and their fans have taken dates back further. From Michael Jordan’s three-peats to Reggie Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds, followed by Patrick Ewing’s missed layup in 1995 and the injury-riddled squad willing itself to the Finals in 1999, only to get crushed by the San Antonio Spurs, fans have had hope and then watched it get swatted away.\r\n\r\nThose heartbreaking moments led to the slow and steady decline that started in the 2000s. Each move the Knicks made – whether it was bringing in Isiah Thomas as president of basketball operations in late 2003, trading for Brooklyn’s own Stephon Marbury, or then Knicks president Phil Jackson drafting Kristaps Porziņģis – the fleeting hope always gave way to despair.\r\n\r\nThe consecutive sellout streak of Madison Square Garden was gone and so were the A-list stars.\r\n\r\nThe Carmelo Anthony-led Knicks had a brief resurgence, even making the second round of the playoffs before they lost in six games to the Indiana Pacers in 2013. Jeremy Lin in 2012 caught fire and famously scored 38 points to beat the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers as one of the highlights of the short-lived “Linsanity” era.\r\n\r\nBut from that point, it was quiet at Madison Square Garden – until now. Despite being down 3-1 in the series, the Knicks are playing in the Eastern Conference Finals, something they haven’t done in 25 years.\r\n\r\n“It’s decades of disappointment coming out. That’s what I hear,” author Paul Knepper told CNN of the cheers coming from Knicks fans.\r\n\r\nKnepper is a longtime Knicks supporter, took his fandom several steps further and wrote “The Knicks of the Nineties.” The book chronicles the rise and fall of what could be considered the golden era of Knicks basketball for those who weren’t old enough to see Willis Reed hobble onto the Madison Square Garden hardwood for the championship clinching game against the Lakers in 1970 or the subsequent title in 1973.\r\n\r\nKnepper, who grew up on Long Island, was watching Game 1 against the Pacers with his wife in Austin, Texas, where they live. Knepper said she’s not a Knicks fan but roots for them, even though the anxiety and pressure of seeing the historic collapse was almost too painful to watch.\r\n\r\n“She’s like, ‘I don’t know how you do this. This is terrible. How do you watch games like this?’ And I said, ‘I’ve felt this pain before,’” Knepper said. “I felt this pain with Reggie Miller. I felt this pain when Charles Smith couldn’t make a layup in 1993 against the Bulls. I’m familiar with this pain.”\r\n\r\nKnepper says he hears both joy and relief in the screams and cheers from fans.\r\n\r\n“I don’t hear the Carmelo Anthony or the Jeremy Lin era. I hear Phil Jackson and trading Porziņģis and Charles Oakley getting kicked out of the Garden, which, for me, I think, personally, was probably the lowest point in this whole terrible, extended era,” Knepper told CNN Sports. “That’s the kind of stuff that I hear. I hear all of the times there was some degree of hope.”\r\n\r\nImages of an army of Knicks fans spilling out into the streets flooded social media after the Knicks beat the defending champion Boston Celtics in Game 6 of the second round.

He grew up just a mile from the whitewashed cottage to the left of the canvas, owned by tenant farmer Willy Lott, with its charming view over millpond and cornfields, and he rhapsodised about \"the beauty of the surrounding scenery, its gentle declivities, its luxuriant meadow flats…\", writing: \"I associate 'my careless boyhood' with all that lies on the banks of the Stour\".\r\n\r\nYet the rural way of life he depicted did not reflect the industrialisation that was rapidly altering the landscape at the time of painting. While his contemporary JMW Turner was painting a steam train slicing through the canvas, Constable was looking back rather than forward. In many ways, The Hay Wain is a scene that's too good to be true, an anachronism that speaks more to his nostalgia than offering a faithful portrait of rural Suffolk.\r\n\r\nFar from being an objective record of the countryside, the scene inevitably reflects Constable's own standing in society as the son of a landowner, Christine Riding, Director of Collections and Research at the National Gallery, tells the BBC. Just off-canvas is Flatford Mill, owned by the Constable family since 1742. \"He knows that landscape very well, but he knows it from a position of privilege,\" she says. \"It all looks very natural and contented. People know their place in society and are just getting on with it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the scene is less happy when you consider the social context. The agricultural workers pictured in the background often laboured under poor conditions in a precarious and bloated employment market, could not afford to eat the bread that they helped produce, and were about to face even greater hardship when replaced by machines.\r\n\r\nThe picture also ignores the Enclosure Acts (between 1604 and 1914) that placed rural spaces in the hands of the few. \"By the time you get to The Hay Wain, there is very little common land,\" explains Riding. \"He's painting places that his father and his brother have ownership over… but you don't see owners, only labourers.\"", "category": 8, "likes_count": 28, "dislikes_count": 6, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-05-31T17:09:52.879Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T12:26:02.408Z", "tags": [17]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 24, "fields": {"title": "Inside the fascinating world of India's blind cave-dwelling fish", "slug": "article-12", "summary": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.", "image": "article_images/2025/05/31/7cd78d30-3c65-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp", "content": "It was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\r\n\r\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him.\r\n\r\nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\r\n\r\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\r\n\r\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail.\r\n\r\nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\r\n\r\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\r\n\r\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\r\n\r\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\r\n\r\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\r\n\r\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\r\n\r\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\r\n\r\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\r\n\r\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\r\n\r\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators.\r\n\r\nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\r\n\r\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\r\n\r\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\r\n\r\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\r\n\r\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\r\n\r\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\r\n\r\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\r\n\r\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\r\n\r\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"", "category": 9, "likes_count": 24, "dislikes_count": 8, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-05-31T17:13:59.997Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T09:25:15.135Z", "tags": [18, 7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "How protests over designer handbags threw Mongolia into political crisis", "slug": "article-13", "summary": "Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with protesters calling for the resignation of the country’s prime minister over his family’s lavish displays of wealth.", "image": "article_images/2025/06/02/gettyimages-2215724127.webp", "content": "For two weeks, young Mongolians have taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai who will face a vote of confidence in his government on Monday.\r\n\r\nDemocratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country’s democracy.\r\n\r\nHere’s what to know:\r\nThe protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister’s 23-year-old son’s lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car.\r\n\r\nSuspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family.\r\n\r\n“With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy).\r\n\r\nAmina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people.", "category": 4, "likes_count": 11, "dislikes_count": 7, "is_published": true, "created_at": "2025-06-02T09:26:05.057Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-02T09:26:05.057Z", "tags": [7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 26, "fields": {"title": "How San Francisco’s Castro district became the capital of LGBT America", "slug": "article-14", "summary": "In 1965, Life magazine declared San Francisco the capital of gay America.

This phenomenon isn't just about comfort; it's a psychological transformation where we shed our everyday identities through clothing. Unlike the utilitarian outfits designed for pilgrimages or trade expeditions of the past, contemporary holiday attire represents what Marta Franceschini of the European Fashion Heritage Association calls \"a certain relaxation of social dress codes.\" The trend began in the mid-1800s when railways made seaside resorts accessible, prompting new fashion hybrids of elegance and practicality using breathable fabrics like linen. As Franceschini explains: \"The post-World War Two economic boom, coupled with the advent of commercial aviation, democratised travel further. From the 1950s to the '70s, leisurewear evolved into a distinct genre: Capri pants, resort prints, kaftans and cruise collections became staples.\" By the interwar period, designers like Coco Chanel championed relaxed styles that freed travelers from traditional constraints.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0chx.jpg.webp' alt='Getty Images The rise of leisure travel in the mid-1800s brought warm weather destinations into vogue and necessitated lighter fabrics (Credit: Getty Images)'><p>Despite these sartorial freedoms, there's widespread aversion to appearing like a stereotypical tourist, driven by what Dr. Charlotte Russell of The Travel Psychologist identifies as negative connotations of seeming \"naïve\" or \"clumsy with cultural differences.\" Publications overflow with advice on avoiding the reviled tourist uniform - T-shirt, backpack, and hat - while Vanessa Friedman, New York Times fashion critic, taps locals for discreet style guidance because \"people dress to belong... when you're travelling, you don't want to stand out.\" Franceschini traces this anxiety to the late 20th century when globalization widened the \"increasingly codified\" gap between short-term tourists and long-term travelers. Dr. Andrew Stevenson, author of The Psychology of Travel, reframes the dilemma: \"Do you want to present yourself as somebody who's trying to blend in, like an anthropologist? Or erect a barrier because you've got safety concerns? Clothes symbolize how much belongingness we want.\" This psychological tension manifests whether we're signaling professional identity or cultural curiosity through rugged footwear or flowy ensembles.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0cpl.jpg.webp' alt='Alamy What&apos;s so terrible about looking like a tourist, anyway?

Franceschini calls this \"sartorial mimicry,\" where garments express \"an imagined desire to assimilate with local culture,\" though she cautions it risks cultural appropriation when lacking contextual understanding. The Instagram era amplifies these performances, with Russell noting travelers increasingly replicate dressed-up influencers at landmarks that 15 years ago saw functional attire. Franceschini describes how outfits become \"integral to performative self-branding\" with sponsored wardrobes and coordinated palettes, while Stevenson observes: \"Now people take photographs of themselves, and the places... are in the background.\" Betty White's quip resonates: \"Facebook just sounds like a drag; in my day, seeing pictures of people's vacations was considered punishment.\" Ultimately, Franceschini frames holiday dressing as \"a sartorial manifestation of freedom,\" with Russell affirming vacations let us explore \"a more carefree, joyful\" self through clothing choices that defy routine judgments.</p><img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj0dh3.jpg.webp' alt='Getty Images Going someplace new can be a cause for celebration, so it can be fun to dress for the occasion (Credit: Getty Images)'>", "category": 9, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-06-15T13:20:45.640Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-15T13:20:45.640Z", "tags": [7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 56, "fields": {"title": "Equine Therapy Helps Incarcerated Veterans Heal Trauma", "slug": "horse-therapy-veterans", "summary": "A groundbreaking Texas program uses horse-assisted therapy to help incarcerated US veterans address trauma, as nearly one-third of war veterans face arrest or imprisonment - double the civilian rate.", "image": "article_images/2025/06/17/title_image_KraA3b1.webp", "content": "<p><strong>Trigger warning</strong> This article contains graphic descriptions of violence that some readers may find upsetting.</p><h2>A Novel Approach to Veteran Rehabilitation</h2><p>Nearly one-third of the US's war veterans have been arrested or jailed at some point in their lives.

Unlike remote wildlife areas, this refuge sits just 90 minutes from the bustling theme parks of Orlando, blending protected dunes with developed beachfront properties. Sea Turtle Conservancy director David Godfrey explains that thousands of loggerhead and green turtles, along with dozens of leatherbacks, rely on this zone annually for mating and nesting, making it a global biodiversity hotspot where humans and nature must harmoniously coexist for conservation to succeed.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljnc9n.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Alamy The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge is just 90 minutes away from heavily-touristed Orlando (Credit: Alamy)\"/><h2>Threats to Ancient Nesting Rituals</h2><p>Female sea turtles instinctively return to their birth beaches every few years to nest, but this age-old cycle faces modern challenges like light pollution and human structures. Nichole Perna, a land management specialist at the refuge, notes that bright lights can scare turtles away, preventing nesting entirely. Blair Witherington of Inwater Research Group adds that barriers such as breakwaters block access to sandy areas, potentially forcing turtles to abort nests in water where eggs won't survive. The stakes are alarmingly high: only one in 1,000 hatchlings reaches adulthood due to these threats, contributing to why six out of seven sea turtle species are endangered.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljncb1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mariana Zapata It's crucial to avoid disturbing sea turtle nests on Florida's beaches (Credit: Mariana Zapata)\"/><h2>Community-Driven Conservation Success</h2><p>To protect nesting turtles during the season from March to October, the refuge enforces strict rules, including bans on nighttime beach activities, noise, and handheld lights. Property owners must eliminate visible lighting or use low, shielded fixtures with long wavelengths to avoid disorienting turtles. Perna credits these regulations, education campaigns, and development controls for the refuge's dramatic recovery: nest numbers climbed from roughly 13,000 in 1983 to over 44,000 in 2023, establishing it as the world's largest loggerhead nesting ground. However, conflicts occasionally arise, such as when fishermen using lights disturbed a turtle during a guided tour, though Ranger Mairi Brooks noted most visitors cooperate willingly when informed, reinforcing the balance between human recreation and wildlife safety.</p><h2>Experiencing Nature's Wonders Firsthand</h2><p>Guided tours at the refuge offer rare opportunities to observe sea turtles in their natural habitat, like the loggerhead named Jolene monitored by visitors during the nesting season. Participants watch as turtles enter a trance-like state while laying eggs—a behavior unchanged for 100 million years, according to Godfrey. Tours, which run from June for nest watching and August for hatchling surveys, help build public support for conservation by fostering what Witherington calls 'an enthusiastic sea turtle constituency,' demonstrating that protection efforts yield both ecological and economic benefits. Beyond turtles, the refuge supports diverse wildlife such as bobcats, manatees, and mangroves, proving its role as a broader ecosystem sanctuary.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljncby.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brevard County EEL Program Only one in a thousand successfully laid sea turtle eggs will make it to adulthood (Credit: Brevard County EEL Program)\"/><p>For travelers, affordable stays at Floridana Beach Motel or Seashell Suites Resort provide access to local attractions including Juan Ponce de León Landing, Sebastian Inlet State Park, and the Barrier Island Center with interactive sea turtle exhibits.

Before attempting to gather Jasmium, players must prepare for significant environmental hazards in the mining region.</p><h2>Jasmium Crystal locations in Sheol</h2><p>Jasmium Crystals are exclusively found in Sheol's southern mid-section. Mining requires an Industrial Cutteray Mk4 or better, plus radiation protection. It's advisable to approach from the southwest (7-8 o'clock position) using an Ornithopter to avoid ground radiation. Look for large yellowish crystals growing in glowing puddles – avoid stepping in the toxic liquid which causes level 3 radiation immediately.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WqmFcnNHgwxKEFECHUYm5-1200-80.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Sheol showing Jasmium locations marked with rock symbols\"/><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zng9adFRjX59dbXfEx53m5-1200-80.jpg\" alt=\"Hagga Basin entrance point from Dune: World Map\"/><p>Due to the crystals' heavy weight, a single mining trip yields limited quantities.

NHS England emphasizes this staggered approach prioritizes those most in need while managing healthcare resources. The weekly drug induces feelings of fullness to reduce food intake, potentially helping users lose up to 20% of their body weight. Doctors warn of insufficient staffing to handle widespread demand, urging only eligible individuals to seek prescriptions.</p><p>The medication, also known as tirzepatide, was initially approved for type 2 diabetes treatment before receiving authorization for obesity management. Its rollout represents a significant development in addressing weight-related health concerns through pharmaceutical intervention.</p><h2>Who qualifies initially?</h2><p>Eligibility focuses on high-risk patients, though precise criteria remain strict. Qualified recipients will receive combined support including regular health monitoring, exercise guidance, and nutritional counseling. Not all general practices will directly administer prescriptions, with some relying on community clinics instead. Dr. Claire Fuller, NHS England's co-national medical director for primary care, stated: \"This will make a significant difference to lives of people living with obesity and severe ill health.\"</p><p>However, many GP surgeries indicate few patients currently qualify, requesting patience during service setup. Professor Kamila Hawthorne of the Royal College of General Practitioners cautioned: \"We are over-burdened already and lack sufficient workforce.\" She advised against unsolicited GP requests, stressing safety over unregulated online purchases.</p><h2>Implementation barriers</h2><p>Industry experts anticipate supply limitations despite demand. Malcolm Harrison of the Company Chemists' Association noted: \"GP provision alone is unlikely to meet patient demand,\" despite the drug's transformative potential. Additional complexities include mandatory staff training, monthly patient check-ups during initial treatment, and current exclusions for pregnant/breastfeeding individuals or those with pancreatitis or specific thyroid tumor histories. Potential side effects require professional consultation before prescription.</p><h2>Alternative access points</h2><p>Specialist NHS weight-loss clinics have provided Mounjaro since March. Wegovy (semaglutide), another similar injection, remains accessible through these centers. Both medications can also be obtained privately. Dr. Fuller reiterated that not everyone qualifies: \"Discuss NHS support options with healthcare professionals if concerned about weight-related health impacts.\"</p><h2>Future eligibility expansion</h2><p>NHS England projects approximately 220,000 individuals will access Mounjaro over three years through gradual rollout phases. A future evaluation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will determine broader availability, potentially extending eligibility to around 3.4 million people within 12 years.</p><h2>UK-wide disparities</h2><p>Access varies significantly across the UK. Wales currently offers Mounjaro through specialist services while considering primary care integration.

Further releases and an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza were anticipated next, offering both Palestinians and Israelis hope for an end to the devastating conflict.</p><p>However, Netanyahu abruptly ordered renewed attacks across Gaza, declaring hostilities would continue until Hamas was \"completely destroyed.\" The fate of remaining hostages became secondary, provoking outrage among Israelis—especially families with captive relatives—who accused the prime minister of prioritizing political survival over national welfare and hostage safety.</p><p>Three months later, Netanyahu claims victory against Iran after recent hostilities.

Pitt and co-star Damson Idris personally drove Formula 1 cars during filming, accumulating over 6,000 miles behind the wheel. Real-life F1 champion Lewis Hamilton consulted extensively to ensure technical accuracy, but current Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto offer definitive verdicts on the film's realism.</p><p>Gasly and Colapinto attended a special screening ahead of the movie's premiere during the Canadian Grand Prix weekend. They evaluated the depiction of driver experiences, team dynamics, race physics, and regulations.</p><h2>What F1: The Movie Gets Right</h2><p>Gasly highlighted the film's accurate portrayal of team responsibilities and pressure: \"The stakes of carrying the responsibility of a thousand people working in a team is very well showed. It's a sport where you put it all out there, but you're not always rewarded.\"</p><p>Colapinto emphasized how the film conveys the visceral experience missing from broadcasts: \"You can't feel the adrenaline, sound, or vibrations when watching on TV. The movie's camera angles and recreation of scenes capture that unique sensation for fans.\" Gasly added that the data-driven aspects of F1 were \"shown in a very smart way,\" balancing technical precision with cinematic appeal.</p><h2>What F1 Gets Less Right</h2><h2>Sonny’s End of Race Participation</h2><p>Colapinto labeled Brad Pitt's character Sonny racing without practice sessions as \"science fiction.\" Real Formula 1 regulations strictly prohibit drivers from competing without participating in practice or qualifying sessions. While dramatically effective, this storyline element violates official racing protocols.</p><h2>Race Order</h2><p>The film's montage placing the Belgian Grand Prix directly after Mexico's race drew criticism.

A research team at the University of California, Davis, has created an innovative brain-computer interface (BCI) that enables real-time natural conversation for speech-impaired individuals. Unlike text-based systems, this technology interprets brain signals intended for speech muscles, allowing users to communicate verbally and even sing through a computer with near-instantaneous response times.</p><h2>Decoding Speech in Real-Time</h2><p>The system relies on four microelectrode arrays surgically implanted in the brain region responsible for speech production. These devices detect neural activity generated when a person attempts to speak and transmit signals to an AI decoder that converts them into audible speech within just ten milliseconds. Crucially, the technology recreates the individual's authentic voice using a cloning algorithm trained on pre-ALS recordings.</p><p>Beyond standard conversation, the BCI recognizes song attempts and adjusts vocal pitch to match melodies. It also captures nuanced communication elements like interrogative tones, verbal emphasis, and emotional interjections such as \"aah\" or \"ooh.\" This level of expressiveness significantly surpasses previous assistive communication devices.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/1200/675/2-paralyzed-man-speaks-and-sings-with-brain-computer-interface.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"Artificial intelligence translates neural signals into vocal expressions instantly\"/><h4>Artificial intelligence translates neural signals into vocal expressions instantly</h4><hr><h2>Technology Behind Voice Recovery</h2><p>During trials, participants attempted to speak sentences displayed on screens while electrodes recorded firing patterns from numerous neurons.

Amid swirling black smoke and fierce Santa Ana winds in January 2025, he fought not just flames but for personal redemption. Climbing a smoky Altadena mountain with his crew, Fausto witnessed neighborhoods transformed into graveyards of charred cars, glowing living rooms resembling lava, and palm trees turned to torches - over 34,000 acres already consumed.</p><p>\"Damn,\" murmured Fausto, mesmerized by the apocalyptic scene. Wearing his orange uniform and 50-pound pack, he'd battled dozens of fires but never destruction on this scale - 12,000 structures ultimately destroyed, 30 lives lost. As he cleared vegetation to starve the advancing Eaton Fire, Fausto knew this mission represented more than containment: it was his pathway to freedom after sentencing for a 2021 felony involving a fatal shootout.</p><h2>A turning point behind bars</h2><p>Convicted at 16 for second-degree murder after a gang-related incident left two dead, Fausto served time at Alan M. Crogan Youth Treatment Center. The wake-up call came when he saw death firsthand: \"When you see death happen in front of your face, it changes everything.\" After his father's passing during incarceration, Fausto focused on education, earning his high school diploma then becoming the facility's first associate degree graduate through Riverside City College.</p><p>Mentor Carlos Cervantes observed Fausto's transformation: \"He had the drive. The mindset.\" When offered placement in California's inmate firefighter program, Fausto accepted despite uncertainty - seeing an opportunity to earn time credits toward early release from his seven-year sentence. This 108-year-old program employs approximately 1,800 low-security inmates across 35 camps during fire season.</p><h2>Baptism by fire</h2><p>At Pine Grove Conservation Camp in Sierra Nevada foothills, Fausto endured rigorous training - hiking in ill-fitting size 13 boots that bloodied his feet. \"I don't want to quit,\" he insisted through the pain. His persistence paid off when he joined fire crews battling blazes across California. The work proved brutal: 24-hour shifts sleeping on charred ground, drinking a quart of water hourly to avoid dehydration, and facing temperatures exceeding 100°F during record-breaking heat waves.</p><p>Fausto learned to identify heat types - radiant, convection, and conduction - as flames sometimes lashed his cheeks. His crew created vital firebreaks by hand, clearing 300 feet of brush per hour without machinery. When the historic Palisades and Eaton fires erupted near his hometown in January 2025, Fausto's crew deployed immediately. \"We're leaving!\" they shouted, embarking on the seven-hour journey to Altadena where over 1,000 incarcerated firefighters joined the battle.</p><h2>Flames of transformation</h2><p>During rest periods at the Rose Bowl base camp, Fausto received life-changing news from mentor Michael Griggs. His re-entry plan had been approved - probation officials supported his college admission after reviewing his academic record. \"You're going to college,\" Griggs told the stunned firefighter, who still wore his CDC prisoner uniform. Cervantes watched in awe: \"A person getting ready to be released still on the front lines, risking his life.\"</p><p>Nine days into firefighting, a judge approved Fausto's immediate release. He arrived at Cal State San Bernardino carrying his possessions in a black plastic bag. Now majoring in biology, Fausto takes courses in human ecology, philosophy, and rock history while training for basketball tryouts. \"He's exactly where he needs to be,\" says Griggs. \"It represents what second chances look like.\"</p><p>Reflecting on his fire crewmate Gonzalo's definition of identity - \"I'm a man of business\" - Fausto embraces his own purpose: \"I'm here and I've got to do things right and make amends. Now I'm trying to be who I am.\" His journey from incarceration to education, marked by blistered feet amidst the flames, demonstrates that even in destruction, renewal can take root.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/health/a65065585/la-wildfires-incarcerated-firefighter-interview/\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 13, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-01T14:06:05.056Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T14:06:05.056Z", "tags": [112, 131, 101, 7]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 363, "fields": {"title": "M&S Eyes Full Online Recovery Within Four Weeks After Cyber Attack", "slug": "ms-online-recovery-four-weeks", "summary": "Marks & Spencer expects to fully restore online services including click-and-collect within four weeks as recovery progresses after an April cyber attack that halted half its digital operations.

Angela McConville of childbirth charity NCT emphasized that supporting families requires \"accessible postnatal care, affordable childcare, and cost-of-living action.\"</p><h2>Diversity and Birth Patterns</h2><p>Births to parents born outside the UK rose to 40.4% in England (from 38.2%) and 19.4% in Wales (from 17.5%). For the third consecutive year, India remained the most common birth country for non-UK-born parents. Intriguingly, December 26th was the least common birthday for the twelfth straight year, while February 23rd saw the most births. Tuesday was the most frequent birth weekday, with weekends recording the fewest deliveries.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0vvr9j1dxo\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 13, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-01T14:37:59.403Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T14:37:59.403Z", "tags": [131, 72, 492, 176, 471, 93]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 368, "fields": {"title": "University Staff Back Strikes Over Major Job Cut Plans", "slug": "university-staff-strike-job-cuts", "summary": "Staff at the University of Nottingham have voted overwhelmingly in favor of industrial action over plans to eliminate 258 professional service roles, citing drastic restructuring plans amid financial pressures.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/01/title_image_r0yJ4Ut.webp", "content": "<p>Staff at the University of Nottingham have strongly endorsed strike action against proposed job reductions that target 258 professional service positions.

The ripple effects extend to pharmaceutical innovation, as scientific uncertainty discourages investment in vaccine research.</p><h2>Rebuilding Trust Through Equity and Engagement</h2><p>Meaningful solutions require recognizing why distrust exists. Marginalized communities have long faced medical racism and systemic neglect, making vaccine hesitancy understandable. Effective strategies involve:<br>1. Mobile vaccination units to reach underserved areas<br>2. Collaboration with trusted community leaders<br>3.

The regulations, part of the Future Homes Standard to be published this autumn, mandate solar panels unless specific exemptions apply, such as properties being heavily shaded. Miliband described the policy as \"just common sense,\" stating it would save households approximately £500 annually on energy bills while accelerating the shift toward renewable energy.</p><p>The regulations follow prior proposals from the Conservative government, which had suggested solar coverage for 40% of a home's ground area. However, Miliband clarified that unlike previous plans that waived requirements if the 40% threshold couldn't be met, the new rules will insist on some solar installation even when full coverage is unattainable. He emphasized that solar adoption must be \"almost universal\" on new builds, with only rare exceptions.</p><h2>Industry Concerns</h2><p>The Home Builders Federation supports expanding solar usage but warns against excessive bureaucracy. Neil Jefferson, the organization's head, noted that two in five new homes already feature panels and cautioned that requiring builders to seek individual exemptions could create \"burdensome\" paperwork and undermine the government's target of constructing 1.5 million homes by 2029. He stated, \"The government needs to take care not to prescribe too much on rooftops\" to avoid slowing housing delivery.</p><p>Solar Energy UK's Chris Hewett estimated 90% of new builds will require panels under the rules and called for local authorities to enforce compliance vigilantly. He acknowledged workforce training gaps, telling media, \"We need to train more people... that's something we as an industry are working on.\" Responding to concerns about costs inflating home prices, Miliband asserted the change wouldn't adversely affect housing affordability.</p><h2>Climate Objectives</h2><p>The initiative supports Britain's legally binding goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Residential buildings accounted for 20% of UK greenhouse gases in 2022, and the Climate Change Committee has warned that decarbonizing housing is essential for meeting targets. Solar power generation reached record UK levels between January and May this year—42% higher than the same period last year and 160% greater than a decade prior—though it remains the nation's sixth-largest electricity source.</p><p>Political parties remain divided on net zero timelines. While Labour retains the 2050 target and recently simplified heat pump installation rules, Conservatives argue it risks lowering living standards. The Liberal Democrats welcomed the solar mandate, with MP Max Wilkinson calling it a win for bill savings and emissions cuts.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j728gvp94o\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 6, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-05T16:33:34.668Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-05T16:33:34.668Z", "tags": [101, 108, 173, 622, 93]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 451, "fields": {"title": "UK Proposes Major Changes to Google Search Dominance", "slug": "google-search-rival-links-uk", "summary": "UK regulators propose measures to increase competition in search services, potentially requiring Google to offer users alternative providers and enhance transparency.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/05/title_image_PRXycpy.webp", "content": "<p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating Google under new legislation that could mandate changes to the search giant's operations.

Though unclear when price increases might occur, switching to US-manufactured alternatives safeguards your budget. Luckily, numerous American brands handle both headquarters and production stateside.</p><p>The key distinguisher: brands must manufacture domestically, not just maintain US headquarters. For those needing recommendations, the following list highlights reliable American-made options tested across all skincare categories.</p><h2>What to Consider</h2><p>Verifying manufacturing location is crucial—some US-based brands produce overseas. This list confirms each company creates products domestically, even if facilities are in different states.</p><p>Brand specialization matters when choosing. Companies excel in specific categories: Baxter of California offers top facial scrubs, while Bravo Sierra dominates deodorants. Focusing on a brand’s expertise typically yields better results in your priority areas.</p><p>Budget options provide fundamental benefits without complexity. Examples include Marlowe’s $14 cleanser, effective across skin types but without specialized features. Even basic formulas can deliver reliable performance.</p><p>Mid-range products ($25-$50) feature targeted ingredients for specific concerns. Atwater’s $32 Eye Armor combats wrinkles and puffiness, while Brickell’s $40 anti-aging serum outperforms budget alternatives with enhanced formulations for better hydration and skin support.</p><p>Premium skincare ($50+) falls into two categories: value-sized essentials or advanced formulas with luxury textures. Products like Dr Dennis Gross’s $70+ wrinkle cream demonstrate clinically-proven ingredients that visibly improve firmness and radiance, making the investment worthwhile for noticeable improvements.</p><h2>How We Selected</h2><p>As a grooming editor constantly testing new releases across 50+ brands, selections derive from rigorously evaluated moisturizers, serums, creams, and cleansers.

Dr. Matthew Edwards from Wake Forest University noted 10-35% of seniors develop this condition, which while sometimes linked to serious ailments, typically remains benign.</p><p>Besides age, risk factors include obesity, blood clot history and occupations requiring prolonged standing.

This medication forms part of Trump's cardiovascular prevention regimen but can exacerbate bruising. Dr. Edwards confirmed this explanation as plausible, noting elderly aspirin users become bruise-prone naturally.</p><p>Medical experts stated hand bruises require substantial force to appear.

While Scotland and Wales already permit 16-year-olds to vote in local and devolved elections, England and Northern Ireland maintain an 18-year minimum for parliamentary elections.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner defended the policy: \"I was a mum at 16, you can go to work, you can pay your taxes and I think that people should have a vote at 16.\" However, Conservative shadow minister Paul Holmes criticized the plan as \"hopelessly confused,\" questioning why voting rights wouldn't align with other age-restricted activities like purchasing alcohol or joining the military.</p><p>Despite concerns the change could favor Labour among traditionally left-leaning youth, recent polls indicate potential vote fragmentation among the Greens, Liberal Democrats, and Reform UK.

Reed stated that people across the nation are \"furious\" about what he described as a \"broken\" system and accepted that his performance could be judged at the next general election should improvements fail to materialize.</p><h2>Record Pollution Levels</h2><p>According to Environment Agency data released on Friday, serious pollution incidents by water companies in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest number ever recorded. A total of 2,801 pollution incidents occurred during the year, up from 2,174 in 2023, with 75 cases considered seriously harmful to fisheries, drinking water sources, and human health.

Environmental charity River Action UK cautioned that the discharge reduction pledge remained a non-binding \"political commitment\" rather than a legally enforceable target. The plan includes coordinated efforts with devolved governments to ban plastic-containing wet wipes as part of broader environmental reforms.</p><p>The water sector is slated to receive a record £104 billion investment over the next five years for infrastructure improvements, potentially raising average household bills by £123 annually—with Southern Water customers facing increases up to £224. The Environment Agency will get £189 million to fund hundreds of enforcement officers to monitor compliance and prosecute violations. England's aging combined sewage systems, which handle both rainwater and wastewater, sometimes overflow during heavy rainfall, though serious pollution events violate companies' legal obligations regardless of weather conditions.</p><p>Among 4,000 inspections conducted last year, nearly a quarter of sites violated their permits. Opposition leaders proposed alternatives: Reform UK's Nigel Farage advocated regulated public-private ownership models, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey pushed to replace Ofwat with public benefit corporations. Natural Resources Wales reported 132 sewage spills attributable to Welsh Water during 2024, including four serious incidents resulting in the highest pollution rate per infrastructure length nationwide.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/86f3/live/4344a710-63f7-11f0-b6f0-53138033c34e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A boy in his shorts crouches in a stream of water on a beach next to a large mossy pipe with a grill on the end.

The installation exemplifies her philosophy rejecting divisions between humans and nature. \"I dislike the separation of culture and nature,\" Pessoa stated. \"I imagine an integrated natural philosophy where culture is nature's extension.\"</p><p>Her practice consistently employs organic elements like bodily fluids, hair, and dirt. Cathedral (1990–2015), a sprawling leather installation embedded with human tresses, demonstrates this approach. Thomas D. Trummer, director of Kunsthaus Bregenz, observed: \"She’s sensitive to anything living - plants, seeds, animals, individuals.

Though she maintained she never sought scandal, she's never participated in Brazil’s prestigious Bienal de São Paulo. Art historian Cecilia Fajardo-Hill noted her work only recently gained due recognition \"beyond Brazil's confines,\" partially because she avoided artistic hubs like São Paulo by remaining in Minas Gerais state.</p><p>International acclaim now blossoms through venues including the 2022 Venice Biennale and simultaneous exhibitions in Aspen and Glasgow. \"Time has helped me grow,\" reflected Pessoa. Her art has physically expanded too - Deliria Deveras (2021–24) fills an Aspen gallery with 20 tons of crystals and silver mined near her Ferros birthplace. Recalling Robert Smithson's land art while diverging through spiritual intent, she described pursuing \"the psychology of man’s relationship with an earthly God.\"</p><img src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_06_30_ASPEN72416.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"Massive crystal and silver installation covering gallery floor expanse\"/><h4>Massive crystal and silver installation covering gallery floor expanse</h4><hr><h2>Roots and Evolution</h2><p>Growing amidst Minas Gerais' mining culture, Pessoa calls herself a miner of both minerals and meaning. Her farm childhood surrounded by Baroque churches informs her aesthetic; sculptures often reference Saint statues adorned with human hair. Inspiration flows from sources as varied as land artist Smithson and 18th-century Brazilian sculptor Aleijadinho. \"These sacks are Baroque,\" she asserted, \"through their folding, verticality, and emotional intensity.\"</p><p>Since the 1990s, her unconventional sculptures - bone circles, hay knots, vegetable fiber masses - made her \"a real outlier,\" according to Wood. She resisted conformity despite backlash, creating visceral works like Lesmalongas – Desterros where performers screamed in agony while wearing sculptures made of lard and dirt. \"I like when works take me out of my comfort zone,\" Pessoa acknowledged.</p><img src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_06_30_ASPEN72580.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"Detailed rows of burlap sacks filled with organic materials and texts\"/><h4>Detailed rows of burlap sacks filled with organic materials and texts</h4><hr><p>Recently she has explored durable materials like bronze and soapstone.

Today we could hit nine in southern England and South Wales.\"</p><h2>Causes of Heightened Radiation</h2><p>Multiple factors contribute: the recent summer solstice positions the sun higher in the sky, while exceptional ozone depletion occurred over the northern hemisphere during winter and spring due to natural weather patterns. Reduced pollution levels under lockdown conditions also minimize UV scattering.</p><h2>Health Dangers</h2><p>While sunlight provides essential vitamin D, excessive UV exposure causes sunburn, skin cancer, and eye cataracts. Dr. Michaela Hegglin of Reading University advises: \"Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen, and slap on a hat during peak hours.\" Temperature doesn't determine UV strength – 20°C days can be as damaging as 30°C. Helen Willetts of BBC Weather warns: \"UV penetrates thin clouds, so burning risk persists even when it doesn't feel intensely sunny.\"</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/7D95/production/_113094123_1500-3_reuters_hi062113956.jpg\" alt=\"Crowded beach in the UK\"/><h4>Crowded beach in the UK</h4><hr><h2>Protection Measures</h2><p>Prevent UV damage by frequently applying high-factor sunscreen (especially for fair skin), avoiding midday sun exposure, and wearing UV-blocking sunglasses.

His victories and setbacks demonstrate both the promise and pitfalls of extreme carb-loading in endurance sports.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/20/title_image_w8wPbtz.webp", "content": "<h2>An Audacious Challenge</h2><p>In 2024, coach and ultrarunner David Roche announced an ambitious goal: breaking the nearly two-decade-old record of 15 hours, 42 minutes at Colorado's legendary Leadville Trail 100 Mile race. This stunned the running community as Roche had never before raced the 100-mile distance. Despite doubts, Roche believed emerging innovations—including carbon-plated shoes and sodium bicarbonate supplementation—combined with a radical high-carb fueling strategy could make the impossible achievable.</p><p>His confidence stemmed from a meticulous spreadsheet predicting a 15-minute margin under the record through consuming 120-140 grams of carbohydrates (500+ calories) per hour. This approach originated in elite cycling and was gaining traction among endurance athletes. Roche became one of its chief proponents, preparing to test it under Leadville's grueling conditions.</p><h2>Unlikely Origins</h2><p>Roche's path to ultrarunning prominence was unconventional. Growing up as a 200-pound football player in Maryland, he initially believed his athletic limits capped at 800-meter runs. After quitting Columbia University's football team, he discovered trail running while studying environmental law at Duke, where he met his wife Megan, now his coaching partner.</p><p>After moving to Boulder, Colorado, the couple built successful coaching careers, but fatherhood in 2022 sparked urgency in Roche. When Megan urged him to \"shoot your shot,\" he entered the 2023 Canyons 100k. A nutrition-related vomiting episode there prompted his carb-loading experiments, culminating in a victory at the McDowell Mountain 50-miler and qualification for Leadville via the Silver Rush 50 win.</p><h2>Redefining Limits</h2><p>Roche trained simultaneously for running endurance and caloric intake capacity. \"I trained like a competitive eater,\" he said, practicing with fluids to tolerate up to 56 ounces hourly. Even a training accident—a car collision that broke his wrist—didn't derail preparations.</p><p>At Leadville, initial doubts vanished when heart-rate data confirmed he could sustain higher intensity with proper fueling. His rule: run every step, no walking. Pacer Teddy Bross witnessed remarkable consistency, noting Roche looked identical at miles 40 and 60. Despite brief nausea on the Powerline climb, Roche finished in 15:26:34—shattering the record by over 16 minutes.</p><h2>Scientific Debate</h2><p>Roche's success ignited discussions about high-carb fueling's validity. Exercise scientist Alex Hutchinson called it \"an open question scientifically,\" citing challenges in testing extremes through ultrarunning trials. Veteran coach Andy Jones-Wilkins labeled it \"an incredible marketing opportunity\" potentially unsuitable for non-elites.</p><p>Experts cautioned that gastrointestinal distress risks increase with age and slower paces. Author Jason Koop noted cycling's peloton has long used such strategies but emphasized few athletes actually need extreme fueling. Coach Tyler Fox advocated \"fueling the work,\" stressing carbohydrate intake must align with sustained effort intensity to avoid digestive issues.</p><p>Anna Gibson, a sub-ultra runner coached by Roche, credited 110g/hour carb intake with her 30k course record. Hutchinson summarized: \"David weighs the odds and says, 'So you're telling me there's a chance!''</p><h2>Beyond Leadville</h2><p>Roche recovered rapidly, attributing his resilience to carb-loading's training and recovery benefits. To test if Leadville was a fluke, he raced Arizona's Javelina Jundred two months later, winning in 12:45:04 despite 100◦F heat. This earned him entry to the Western States 100.</p><p>At Western States, Roche initially ran fifth among elites like Kilian Jornet.

Pollution incidents hit record levels this year, including 75 serious cases threatening human and aquatic health, with Thames Water accounting for 33.

Understanding this pleasure center is crucial for satisfying sexual experiences and orgasms.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/21/title_image_M41Oy57.webp", "content": "<h2>Understanding the Clitoris</h2><p>The clitoris serves as the primary pleasure center for individuals with female anatomy, uniquely designed solely for pleasure. It contains approximately 10,000 nerve endings—equivalent to the penile head but in a smaller area, making it highly sensitive. Renowned sex therapist Dr. Laurie Mintz highlights its parallel importance to the male penis: \"The clitoris and penis develop from the same embryonic tissue.\" Yet misconceptions about its appearance and significance remain widespread.</p><h2>Anatomy and Location</h2><p>While externally visible as a small bud (glans clitoris) at the vulva's apex, the organ extends internally throughout the pelvic region. The internal structure, stretching up to 5 inches in some individuals, includes vestibular bulbs and cura that form a wishbone-like shape. Like a penis, it contains erectile tissue that engorges during arousal. Crucially, the clitoris belongs to the vulva—not the vagina—and plays a fundamental role in sexual stimulation.</p><h2>Importance for Sexual Satisfaction</h2><p>Clitoral stimulation proves vital for orgasms, as studies confirm only 5-15% of female-bodied individuals orgasm through penetration alone. Sex coach Lucy Rowett emphasizes: \"Most achieve orgasms through external clitoral stimulation.\" Treating such contact as equally essential to intercourse—not merely \"foreplay\"—transforms sexual dynamics. Mintz advises partners to take turns focusing on each other's pleasure rather than expecting simultaneous orgasms.</p><h2>Practical Stimulation Techniques</h2><p>Begin with arousal-building activities before direct contact. Use ample lubricant to avoid discomfort, as Rowett notes: \"Dry rubbing feels like sliding down waterless slides.\" Prioritize gentle pressure, circling motions around the clitoris, and involving the full vulva. Combine clitoral focus with G-spot stimulation using \"come hither\" finger motions. Incorporate vibrators during intercourse and positions like cowgirl for optimal access. Open communication about preferences remains essential since responses vary.</p><h2>Common Questions Answered</h2><p>\"Is the clitoris the same as the G-spot?\" The structures connect internally—the G-spot stimulates the clitoral body through the vaginal wall. \"Do all women enjoy clitoral stimulation?\" While most do, individual preferences vary significantly. \"Does clitoral touch guarantee orgasms?\" Experts advise focusing on pleasure rather than outcomes, as orgasm involves complex neurological responses. Successful sexual experiences prioritize mutual communication and exploration.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a64703131/how-to-find-the-clit/\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 13, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-21T19:53:52.114Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-21T19:53:52.114Z", "tags": [72, 716, 717, 718, 719]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 580, "fields": {"title": "Unraveling the Truth Behind Ozzy Osbourne's Bat and Dove Incidents", "slug": "ozzy-osbourne-bat-dove-incident-truth", "summary": "This article investigates the infamous incidents where rock legend Ozzy Osbourne allegedly bit the heads off animals during concerts and meetings, exploring conflicting accounts to separate fact from rock mythology.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/23/title_image.webp", "content": "<p>In rock music's history of outrageous behavior, few stories rival Ozzy Osbourne's alleged animal incidents.

Employ a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords rather than reusing credentials across multiple platforms.</p><p>Comprehensive antivirus software provides critical protection by detecting phishing attempts, blocking malicious websites, and alerting users to emerging threats before damage occurs. Such programs are especially valuable in preventing malware installations from scam links that could compromise private data. Since scammers often build convincing emails using personal details like names and addresses sourced from data broker sites, using a personal data removal service can reduce your digital footprint and minimize targeting opportunities.</p><p>Suspicious messages should be reported through Amazon's self-service reporting tool for verified customers. Others can email reportascam@amazon.com directly. Submitting these reports enables Amazon to investigate and take action against malicious actors, disrupting scams proactively.</p><h2>Key security insights</h2><p>Impersonation scams extend beyond Amazon, requiring caution with all email communications. Always scrutinize messages carefully for red flags like unusual domain names, misspellings, or unnatural language patterns. Scammers rely on urgency and panic to provoke hasty responses, so taking a moment to verify communication legitimacy provides critical protection against increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts.</p><p>Copyright 2025 CyberGuy.com.

Warning signs like dizziness or fatigue often emerge before individuals recognize they're dehydrated. At the point of feeling thirsty, the body is already experiencing fluid deficit. The innovative wearable hydration sensor solves this problem by delivering real-time data, empowering users to proactively maintain hydration rather than react to symptoms after they occur.</p><h2>How the wearable hydration sensor works</h2><p>Engineered at the University of Texas at Austin, this sensor detects early dehydration using bioimpedance technology. It transmits a painless, low-level electrical current through the bicep and measures how efficiently it travels through tissue. Well-hydrated tissues conduct electricity easily, while dehydrated ones create resistance. The device wirelessly connects to a smartphone app, providing immediate hydration updates without disrupting daily activities or requiring clinical tests.</p><h2>Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health</h2><p>This technology offers practical advantages across multiple scenarios. Athletes can use it to prevent fatigue and cramping during intense training in hot conditions. Firefighters and police officers wearing heavy gear in high temperatures gain critical safety monitoring. Even office workers missing water breaks during long meetings receive timely reminders. For patients managing kidney or cardiovascular conditions requiring precise hydration balance, the device offers a non-invasive alternative to current clinical methods.</p><h2>The science behind the hydration sensor</h2><p>Researchers validated the sensor's accuracy through controlled experiments where participants took diuretics to simulate dehydration. Continuous readings from the sensor matched urine analysis results that measured biochemical hydration markers. This demonstrated the technology's reliability during normal activities like walking or working. Co-author Matija Jankovic confirmed that arm bioimpedance measurements accurately reflected whole-body hydration changes, establishing it as a dependable monitoring method.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1200/675/2-smart-wearable-tracks-your-hydration-in-real-time.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system.\"/><h4>Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system.</h4><hr><h2>Traditional hydration tests fall short</h2><p>Conventional hydration checks like urine analysis or blood tests are impractical for daily use due to their time-consuming nature and need for laboratory processing. Existing commercial monitors are often bulky and restrict movement. This sensor overcomes these limitations with its portable, lightweight design that operates continuously during exercise, work, or routine life without requiring users to remain stationary.</p><h2>What's next for hydration tracking</h2><p>The current model measures relative hydration shifts, but researchers plan to collect population-wide data to establish baseline measurements for absolute hydration levels. They're also developing enhanced designs including breathable electronic tattoos and sweat-resistant sensors for extended comfort. Future versions might monitor other body areas like forearms or thighs. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu envisions making seamless, real-time hydration tracking universally accessible across all lifestyles and professions.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1200/675/3-smart-wearable-tracks-your-hydration-in-real-time.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"A woman sweating during a workout.\"/><h4>A woman sweating during a workout.</h4><hr><h2>What this means for you</h2><p>This technology simplifies hydration management by replacing guesswork with precise data.

Research reveals that about half of popular ADHD content on social media contains misinformation, ranging from medication fears to unproven remedies. Simultaneously, prescription shortages and governmental scrutiny of ADHD drugs create additional challenges. Psychiatrist Dr. Javier Quintero explains that drug-free interventions are gaining recognition for enhancing organizational skills, emotional control, and stress management: \"They can reduce medication dosage while improving daily functioning and quality of life.\" Below are science-backed strategies for those seeking alternatives or complementary approaches.</p><h2>Double-Check Your Diagnosis</h2><p>Accurate identification of ADHD is essential before pursuing treatment. Dr. Gregory Scott Brown highlights that many adults assume they have ADHD without proper diagnosis. True ADHD symptoms emerge before age 12, though they may remain undiagnosed for years. He cautions that concentration problems often stem from burnout, depression, or anxiety instead of ADHD. Professional evaluation helps differentiate these conditions.</p><h2>Ask About New Meds</h2><p>If standard stimulants cause side effects or prove ineffective, consider newer alternatives. Beyond traditional options, the FDA recently approved viloxazine (Qelbree), a non-stimulant medication targeting brain chemicals associated with ADHD. Additional treatments are under investigation, including centanafadine. Dr. Quintero notes that this triple reuptake inhibitor shows comparable efficacy to stimulants in clinical trials while affecting serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine pathways.</p><h2>Commit to Therapy</h2><p>Therapy begins by identifying ADHD's specific impact on daily life to establish targeted goals. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) demonstrates strong effectiveness by modifying unhelpful thought patterns and improving organization and emotional regulation. For instance, replacing thoughts like \"I can't do anything right\" with situation-specific analysis reduces shame and boosts productivity. Alternatively, ADHD coaches provide practical organization strategies. Though unlicensed, reputable coaches hold certifications from bodies like the Professional Association for ADHD Coaches requiring training and testing.</p><h2>Double Down on Wellness</h2><p>Mindfulness practices enhance concentration and emotional control despite being challenging for ADHD patients. Structured options like meditation apps or workshops aid implementation. Technology-based interventions such as EndeavorOTC show promise—an FDA-authorized app using game-like tasks improved focus for 83% of users in clinical trials. Physical activity also offers significant benefits; cycling particularly strengthens inhibitory control. Just 20 minutes of daily aerobic exercise can augment attention, memory, and mood regulation.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/health/a65479544/adhd-meds-and-alternatives/\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 13, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-24T19:00:06.589Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-24T19:00:06.589Z", "tags": [130, 72, 649, 427, 756, 309]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 646, "fields": {"title": "Ancient 5,000-Year-Old Cairn in Yorkshire Dales Gains Protected Status", "slug": "england-protects-5000-year-old-cairn", "summary": "England has granted legal protection to Dudderhouse Hill long cairn, a 5,000-year-old Neolithic structure in the Yorkshire Dales National Park that predates Stonehenge, safeguarding the nationally important archaeological site from damage and raising public awareness about its cultural significance.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/24/title_image_MgUJlPi.webp", "content": "<p>Dudderhouse Hill long cairn, a prehistoric stone structure dating back approximately 5,000 years, has been designated as a protected monument by English heritage authorities.

This Post-Impressionist masterpiece captures Parisian leisure-seekers at a Seine riverside park, creating an arresting paradox: modern spontaneity frozen into chromatic permanence. Seurat merged classical influences from his École des Beaux-Arts training under Henri Lehmann, a disciple of neoclassicist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, with radical color science from Michel Eugène Chevreul's 1839 treatise on simultaneous color contrasts. \"Some say they see poetry in my paintings,\" Seurat remarked. \"I see only science.\"</p><h2>Setting and Social Contrasts</h2><p>The Île de la Grande Jatte—named for its bowl-like depression—became a fashionable retreat after 19th-century urban renovations. Seurat depicted this locale as a deliberate counterpart to his earlier 'Bathers at Asnières', which portrayed working-class men just across the Seine. Both paintings share geographic elements like a railway bridge while creating a sociological diptych: 'Bathers' faces leftward with proletarian informality while 'La Grande Jatte's bourgeois figures face right in structured promenades. Seurat executed over 70 studies transitioning from crosshatched brushwork to precise dots during 1884-1886.</p><h2>Symbolism and Lasting Influence</h2><p>The painting encodes subtle commentary through symbols like a woman fishing (suggesting solicitation) and a monkey on a leash—'singesse' being French slang for prostitute. Exhibited at the 1886 Impressionist show, it initially faced derision; critic Joris-Karl Huysmans dismissed it: \"Strip his figures of the colored fleas... underneath there is nothing.\" Undeterred, Seurat expanded pointillism, later adding border-dot frames that intensified optical engagement. His sudden death at 31 curtailed his career but solidified 'La Grande Jatte' as an enduring landmark that relies equally on viewer perception and artist intention for its effects.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/?p=1234747593\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 8, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-25T14:04:17.072Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-25T14:04:17.072Z", "tags": [17, 339, 532, 760, 761, 762]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 659, "fields": {"title": "Coroner Rules Jay Slater's Death as Accidental After Tenerife Ravine Fall", "slug": "jay-slater-accidental-death-tenerife", "summary": "A coroner has ruled 19-year-old Jay Slater from Oswaldtwistle died accidentally after falling in a ravine during a holiday in Tenerife.

Apollo Art Auctions intends to sell the ivory-and-wood cosmetic container on July with estimates reaching £300,000-£500,000 ($400,000-$675,000).</p><h2>Contested History</h2><p>Experts contend British archaeologist Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, may have illicitly appropriated the artifact. Carter spent years cataloging thousands of tomb artifacts, with allegations indicating some entered his personal collection. The auction house asserts the piece underwent Art Loss Register verification and includes provenance documentation.</p><h2>Object Details and Ownership Trail</h2><p>Dubbed the 'Guennol Grasshopper', the artifact features ivory upper wings with checkerboard patterns, wooden lower wings, and black inset eyes. Its cavity was designed for kohl or perfume storage. Auction records note previous ownership by collector Joseph Brummer, the Guennol Collection, and the Merrin Gallery since 2007, with exhibition history at Brooklyn Museum (1948-2002) and Met (1969). The Guennol Collection held by philanthropists Alastair and Edith Martin yielded a record-breaking $57.1 million sale for a 5,000-year-old lioness sculpture in 2007.</p><h2>Expert Disputes and Legal Ambiguity</h2><p>Christian Loeben, curator at Germany's Museum August Kestner, argues stylistic elements and pristine condition indicate origins in Tutankhamun's sealed tomb: \"I'm quite convinced... it existed in exactly the period of the pharaoh's reign.\" Apollo counters that \"no documented evidence\" ties it to the tomb, noting its absence from excavation inventories. Art Loss Register's James Ratcliffe acknowledged the artifact occupies \"an awkward area\" since Egypt hasn't officially claimed it.</p><h2>Repatriation Debates</h2><p>Former Met director Thomas Hoving linked the piece to Tutankhamun's tomb in his 1978 book. This sale follows patterns of reparation, including Carter's posthumously returned artifacts and the Met's 2010 return of 19 tomb-originating items. Loeben insists on ethical restitution: \"It's a moral question.\" Egypt has yet to file a formal claim for the grasshopper despite expert appeals.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/?p=1234748248\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 8, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-26T18:46:04.601Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-26T18:46:04.601Z", "tags": [192, 193, 552, 683, 17]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 709, "fields": {"title": "England's Lionesses and Their Unseen Supporters: The Team Behind the Team", "slug": "lionesses-families-support-euro-2025-journey", "summary": "As England's women's football team competes in the Euro 2025 final, family and friends share emotional insights about their vital off-field support during the tournament's rollercoaster journey in Switzerland.", "image": "article_images/2025/07/27/title_image.webp", "content": "<p>The inner circle of England's women's football team recently gathered in Switzerland for a group outing, demonstrating the powerful bonds formed among players' families and friends throughout the Euro 2025 tournament.</p><p>While supporters witnessed England's dramatic progression through five matches over three weeks, the experience proved even more intense for loved ones in the stands who lived every heart-stopping moment.

The illness is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted through bites from black-legged deer ticks, potentially leading to severe muscle and joint pain, Lyme arthritis, cardiac complications, and neurological conditions if untreated.</p><h2>How to identify Lyme disease infection</h2><p>Between 60% and 80% of infected individuals develop a distinctive rash, often resembling a bull's-eye pattern following a tick bite. Symptoms typically emerge two weeks after exposure and can worsen without treatment. Early treatment during the rash phase is crucial to prevent severe complications.</p><p>If left untreated, patients may later develop serious conditions including Bell's palsy causing facial paralysis, Lyme meningitis with severe headaches and neck stiffness, or carditis involving heart tissue inflammation.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1200/675/woman-tired-joint-pain.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"Woman joint pain\"/><h4>Woman experiencing joint pain symptoms</h4><hr><p>Additional indicators include fever, cognitive difficulties described as brain fog, dizziness, heart palpitations, and nerve pain.

Epidemiologists recommend post-exposure prophylaxis with a 200-mg dose of doxycycline antibiotic taken within 72 hours of a high-risk tick bite.</p><p>While this preventative approach proves effective in most cases, some physicians advocate for more extensive treatment. One specialist commented, \"I don&#39;t feel comfortable with a single dose if I really want to avoid Lyme,\" suggesting longer antibiotic courses and follow-up assessments after one month to screen for co-infections.</p><img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1200/675/deer-tick-close-up.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\" alt=\"Deer tick close-up\"/><h4>Close-up view of a deer tick</h4><hr><p>For confirmed Lyme disease cases, treatment typically involves antibiotics like doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime prescribed for 10 days to six weeks depending on severity.

One topic he couldn't sidestep was Jeffrey Epstein, as criticism over withheld government documents trailed him to Scotland with a van displaying their shared past picture.</p><h2>Epstein Scandal Surfaces</h2><p>For the first time, Trump explained their falling out, claiming Epstein poached staff from his Mar-a-Lago estate and insisting he ceased communication afterward. He also denied ever sending sexually suggestive drawings to Epstein, asserting he only sketches buildings. Despite the intrusion, little dampened his mood—few scattered protests were peaceful, while adoring fans hailed him at airports and golf clubs.</p><p>Seizing opportunities to flaunt his properties, Trump hosted Starmer and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Turnberry's newly renovated ballroom, bragging about opulent ceilings during talks on Gaza.

Both treadmills and ellipticals elevate your heart rate and provide adjustable speed, incline and resistance. Their mechanisms, however, significantly impact how they support fitness journeys.</p><p>According to personal trainer Chris Parnell, treadmills offer movement specificity aligning with natural human locomotion. With a motorized belt allowing running in place, they excel for structured training regardless of weather conditions. The machines facilitate interval work through customizable speed adjustments and incline challenges targeting posterior muscles.</p><h2>Key Elliptical Advantages</h2><p>Ellipticals feature dual pedals and handles creating an elliptical motion that mimics walking and running without impact. \"This low-impact quality proves particularly valuable for joint protection,\" notes Parnell. The fixed-path design prevents foot-strike vibrations while supporting balanced movement patterns, making ellipticals optimal for users with weighty builds or existing lower-body concerns.</p><p>The machine's stability enables relaxed, extended workouts. Its reduced coordination demands allow distractions like reading or viewing entertainment without safety risks, easing lengthy sessions.</p><h2>Calorie Burn Comparison</h2><p>Both machines effectively contribute to calorie expenditure through consistent training, though treadmill running typically yields higher rates. The Compendium of Physical Activities indicates vigorous treadmill running at 7 mph burns approximatlely 11 METs versus 9 METs for hard elliptical work. For a 180-pound individual, calculated expenditure reaches 15.5 calories per minute on treadmills versus 12.7 on ellipticals.</p><h2>Decision Factors</h2><p>Selecting equipment involves weighing factors like impact tolerance, weight considerations, injury background and training preferences rather than definitive superiority.

An energy plan released this year called for \"maximizing\" nuclear power to meet growing demand from sectors like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. This week, utility company Kansai Electric Power announced it would explore building a new reactor—a project suspended since 2011.

Northern Ireland lacks real-time spill monitoring, while Scotland collects data from just 27% of overflow points.</p><h2>Why is sewage released into the sea and rivers?</h2><p>Most UK regions operate combined sewer systems channeling both rainwater and household wastewater through shared pipes. During heavy rainfall exceeding ground absorption capacity, overloaded treatment plants risk flooding neighborhoods. To prevent this, systems intentionally discharge excess flow into waterways through overflow outlets.</p><h2>What is a dry spill?</h2><p>Dry spills occur when companies release untreated sewage without significant rainfall, violating permit conditions.

Investigations uncovered approximately 6,000 potential illegal dry spills during 2022.</p><p>Even during wet weather, permits require partial sewage treatment before release.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f1b5/live/d33e2ca0-6641-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp\" alt=\"A diagram showing the process of sewage being spilled into waterways.

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has launched multiple import taxes, arguing they strengthen American manufacturing and protect jobs. His unpredictable trade policies have caused global economic turmoil, prompting companies to raise prices for American consumers.</p><h2>What are tariffs and how do they work?</h2><p>Tariffs function as taxes on internationally purchased goods, typically calculated as a percentage of a product's value. A 10% tariff adds $1 to a $10 item, costing importers $11. Importers must pay the government these fees and may either pass costs to customers or reduce imports. In late May, a US trade court questioned Trump's authority to impose certain tariffs under national emergency powers, though an appeals court allowed their continuation during ongoing litigation.</p><h2>Why is Trump using tariffs?</h2><p>The president claims tariffs will promote US-made goods, increase tax revenue, and stimulate investment while shrinking the trade deficit. He accuses trading partners of unfairly exploiting the US through unfair practices. Trump has targeted specific goods and countries with changing tariff measures, sometimes using them as negotiation tactics for broader demands. These include requirements for China, Mexico, and Canada to curb migration and drug trafficking into the US. On July 14, he warned of potential tariffs on companies trading with Russia if Ukraine peace terms aren't met within 50 days.</p><h2>Which tariffs has the US put in place on specfic goods?</h2><p>US import taxes include 50% on steel, 10% on aluminum, 25% on semiconductors, and 20% on medical devices, notably syringes and dialysis machines. On July 8, Trump threatened a 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals without elaboration.

Negotiations delayed this deadline to August 1. Days before implementation, the US and EU provisionally agreed to 15% tariffs on European goods like cars, pending EU approval, with some American imports entering duty-free. Unless new deals emerge, Canada faces 35% additional tariffs on non-NAFTA goods, Mexico confronts up to 30%, and US-China negotiations continue with existing tariff pauses expiring August 12 after previous duties exceeded 100%.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/2c690320-6d56-11f0-8b42-cf5ae7bf0dcf.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shakes hands with US President Donald Trump during a meeting at Trump Turnberry golf club in Scotland on 27 July 2025\"/><h4>Getty Images European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shakes hands with US President Donald Trump during a meeting at Trump Turnberry golf club in Scotland on 27 July 2025</h4><hr><h2>What have the UK and US agreed on tariffs?</h2><p>The UK secured the lowest tariff rate at 10%. Britain exported £58 billion in goods—primarily vehicles, machinery, and pharmaceuticals—to the US in 2024. The deal provides 0% tariffs on some US ethanol and commits to unchanged food safety standards for limited beef trade. Announced at June's G7 summit, the arrangement allows 100,000 UK car exports annually at the 10% rate before standard 25% duties apply. While exempt from 50% steel tariffs applied elsewhere, UK steel still faces a 25% levy.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/24e7/live/0ba07070-4b31-11f0-aec9-f96b0139508c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters US President Donald Trump holds up a printed copy of the UK-US tariffs deal at the G7 summit in Canada.

Both the International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development downgraded 2025 global growth projections, anticipating negative impacts on the US economy. Despite US GDP growing 3% annually in Q2 2025 after a Q1 contraction, critics within Trump's Republican Party join Democrats and foreign leaders in opposing the measures.</p><h2>Are prices going up for US consumers?</h2><p>Analysts report tariffs are already increasing US inflation, with June prices rising 2.7% annually amid hikes in clothing, coffee, toys, and appliances. Companies are passing costs to buyers—Adidas and Nike will raise US prices as 20% Vietnamese and 19% Indonesian duties affect nearly half of Adidas products, potentially costing Nike $1 billion. Mattel also plans increases. Reduced imports may spike prices for available goods, while products made with imported components, like cars using Mexican parts, face higher costs.

Though based in the same London building as Reform, Orr clarified CBB operates independently from the party.</p><h2>'Surprisingly Welfarist'</h2><p>As chairman of CBB's advisory board, Orr expressed that Reform's potential success would depend on thorough policy preparation. \"If the polls continue to be what they are and Reform ends up governing the country, we should all want them to succeed,\" he stated, emphasizing policies must be \"properly costed\" and coordinated. CBB will operate under a \"post-Brexit, pro-nation, pro-sovereignty\" framework aligned with national conservatism principles.</p><p>Orr described Farage's ideology as \"surprisingly welfarist,\" noting his support for policies like scrapping the two-child benefit cap. However, he maintained Reform remains opposed to excessive state intervention and market regulation. Critics have accused Farage of opportunism for proposing tax cuts and benefits like restoring winter fuel payments without detailed funding plans.</p><p>Looking toward the 2029 general election, Orr stressed Reform must be honest about necessary \"difficult decisions\" to stimulate economic growth. He argued that as a new parliamentary party without established factions, Reform leadership would wield more centralized power than traditional parties during an initial \"honeymoon period.\" Consequently, Orr asserted, the first hundred days would be crucial for administering difficult but necessary policies.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5pl7r11z0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\">Original Article</a></p>", "category": 2, "likes_count": 0, "dislikes_count": 0, "is_published": false, "created_at": "2025-07-31T14:44:14.887Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-31T14:44:14.887Z", "tags": [108, 176, 93, 350, 95]}}, {"model": "MainApp.articles", "pk": 822, "fields": {"title": "Major Healthcare Equipment Supplier Faces Collapse Impacting NHS Services", "slug": "healthcare-supplier-collapse-nhs-impact", "summary": "NRS Healthcare, a major supplier of medical equipment supporting NHS patients and local authorities, is on the brink of failure, risking disruptions to home care and hospital discharges.

Their 2025 survey revealed 68% of undergraduates engaged in term-time employment, rising from 45% in 2022. Additional monthly expenses like food, transportation, and study materials averaged £564 beyond rent.</p><h2>How do student loans work?</h2><p>Most UK students qualify for tuition loans and means-tested maintenance loans that accumulate interest immediately. Repayment stipulations differ nationally. England's amended 2023 repayment rules lengthen payment periods, potentially costing lower and middle earners thousands extra, according to MoneySavingExpert.com. New repayments beginning April 2025 carried an average debt of £53,000 per Student Loans Company data.</p><h2>What extra financial help can students get?</h2><p>Wales and Northern Ireland provide non-repayable maintenance grants. Welsh students receive at least £1,000, rising to £10,124 for low-income students in London. Northern Ireland allows up to £3,475 in grants. Scotland offers aid for specific circumstances such as student parents, with hardship funding accessible UK-wide through universities and charities.</p><h2>Will I earn more money with a degree?</h2><p>Graduates typically out-earn non-graduates, though this advantage has diminished. The Higher Education Statistics Agency's 2021 graduate cohort reported average earnings of £29,699 fifteen months after graduation.

Loans consist of tuition fee coverage and maintenance support, with variations across regions. Tuition fees range up to £9,250 annually in England, £9,000 in Wales, nothing for Scottish students in Scotland (though up to £9,250 for other UK students), and £4,710 in Northern Ireland. Maintenance loans, designed for living expenses, are income-assessed based on household earnings and offer supplements for disabled students or those with children. Students estranged from parents under age 25 may qualify without parental financial review. According to May 2024 research, English maintenance loans cover only half of living costs on average. Graduates in England starting repayments in 2024-25 owe £53,000 on average.</p><h2>How much can I borrow for living costs?</h2><p>Maximum maintenance loans increased for 2025-26 in England and Wales. Students from England living outside London can borrow up to £10,544 (previously £10,227), while Welsh students qualify for £11,345 (up from £11,150). Welsh students may also access non-repayable maintenance grants. In Scotland, under-25s can borrow up to £9,400 plus additional bursaries. Northern Irish students studying away from home get up to £6,776 (£9,492 for London study).</p><h2>How do I get my student loan payments?</h2><p>Tuition fees transfer directly to educational institutions. Maintenance loans enter students' bank accounts through termly installments in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, or monthly in Scotland. Students must register with their university to receive payments—typically in the first week—presenting a finance entitlement letter. English applicants receive payment notifications via text. Funding applications remain open until nine months after the academic year begins. Applications are processed through regional bodies like Student Finance England or Education Authority Northern Ireland.</p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bda4/live/f6a7b030-51c4-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Two female students studying together in a dorm room\"/><h4>Two female students studying together in a dorm room</h4><hr><h2>How much interest will I be charged?</h2><p>Interest accrues immediately upon borrowing, with variable rates across regions. Terms can change post-borrowing, including future rate adjustments. English loans align with retail price index inflation, currently at 4.3% for 2023 cohorts onwards. Students from Wales face inflation-based interest during studies and a fixed rate afterwards. Scotland applies inflation-linked rates during study and post-graduation based on income.</p><h2>When do I have to start paying back my student loan?</h2><p>Repayments begin once earnings exceed regional thresholds: £25,000 in England, £28,470 in Wales, £32,745 in Scotland, and £26,065 in Northern Ireland. Graduates repay 9% of income above these limits. Payments commence nationally the April after course completion, deducted through tax systems. Voluntary additional repayments incur no penalties.</p><h2>Can I get a refund if I pay the wrong amount?</h2><p>Refunds are available for incorrectly processed loan deductions, such as premature repayments, payments after loan clearance, or employer miscalculations. Extra earnings like overtime bonuses sometimes trigger errors if they exceed monthly but not annual thresholds. Over £61 million was refunded to 216,300 graduates in 2023-24, averaging £280. A digital refund service launched in May 2024 saw 400,000 users within six months. Eligibility can be checked via the Student Loans Company website, though voluntary overpayments stay non-refundable.</p><h2>When are student loans written off?</h2><p>Debt clearance occurs after 40 years for English starters in 2025. Wales and Scotland set 30-year limits, while Northern Ireland mandates 25 years.

Aid groups accuse Israel of restricting critical supplies. The Palestinian Authority condemned the proposal, calling for international intervention. The plan conflicts with recent diplomatic momentum toward a two-state solution, as the UK, Canada, and France explore Palestinian state recognition.</p><p>The proposal emerges despite Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza settlements, though Israel maintained tight border control with Egypt. Palestinian officials note that far-right Israeli ministers openly advocate permanent occupation, annexation, and new settlements in Gaza.</p><h2>Planning and Broader Consequences</h2><p>Netanyahu will meet defense officials to discuss encircling Gaza's central refugee camps with combined air and ground operations, potentially starting with military raids. Israeli commentators expressed deep skepticism about the plan's viability, with journalist Nahum Barnea noting: \"Netanyahu has never taken a gamble on this scale before.\" Barnea suggested that after 22 months of conflict, Netanyahu appears focused on prolonging the war rather than achieving stated objectives.</p><p>The conflict began following Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages.
