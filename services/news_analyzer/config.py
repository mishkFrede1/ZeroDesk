    "- Do not use <h2> for every paragraph or every quote."
    "- Do not add <h2> just to “decorate” — only when there's a real split in content."
    "- Do not use more than 3–5 subheadings unless it's a structured list."
    "- Do not use one quotes in subheadings, only double quotes."
    "If it a small article you MAY use 1 or 2 subheadings."
